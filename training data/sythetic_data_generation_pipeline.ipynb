    "C: That’s important to know. Is there any particular position or surface that makes it more challenging for you? For instance, is it harder when you’re sitting on a soft chair or trying to get up from a low bed?\n",
    "P: Yes, it’s definitely harder when I’m sitting on soft surfaces or trying to get up from bed. I feel like I have to use my arms to push myself up.\n",
    "C: I see. And what time of day does this usually happen? Is it worse in the morning or evening?\n",
    "P: Mornings are the hardest. My muscles feel stiff and weak when I first wake up.\n",
    "C: Do you have any equipment nearby, like grab bars or a walker, to help with transfers?\n",
    "P: I do have a walker, but I often forget to bring it close to the bed, so I end up pushing off with my hands or calling my daughter.\n",
    "C: Has there been a time when you felt unsafe or thought you might fall during these transfers?\n",
    "P: Yes, last week I nearly slipped trying to move from the toilet to my wheelchair.\n",
    "C: Are there any surfaces you find easier, like firmer chairs or raised seats?\n",
    "P: Raised seats definitely help. I added a cushion to my armchair, and that’s made it a bit easier.\n",
    "C: Do you feel like your ability to transfer has changed recently—become more difficult over the past few weeks or months?\n",
    "P: Yes, I’ve noticed it getting worse over the last month or so. I feel like I’m losing strength and confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:\n",
    "C: Do you live alone? or is there someone around to help you?\n",
    "P: Yes, I live alone. My daughter works full-time, but she visits me from time to time.\n",
    "C: I see. And how are you feeling right now?\n",

    "C: That’s important to know. Is there any particular position or surface that makes it more challenging for you? For instance, is it harder when you’re sitting on a soft chair or trying to get up from a low bed?\n",

    "C: I see. And what time of day does this usually happen? Is it worse in the morning or evening?\n",
    "P: Mornings are the hardest. My muscles feel stiff and weak when I first wake up.\n",
    "C: Do you have any equipment nearby, like grab bars or a walker, to help with transfers?\n",
    "P: I do have a walker, but I often forget to bring it close to the bed, so I end up pushing off with my hands or calling my daughter.\n",
    "C: Has there been a time when you felt unsafe or thought you might fall during these transfers?\n",
    "P: Yes, last week I nearly slipped trying to move from the toilet to my wheelchair.\n",
    "C: Are there any surfaces you find easier, like firmer chairs or raised seats?\n",
    "P: Raised seats definitely help. I added a cushion to my armchair, and that’s made it a bit easier.\n",
    "C: Do you feel like your ability to transfer has changed recently—become more difficult over the past few weeks or months?\n",
    "P: Yes, I’ve noticed it getting worse over the last month or so. I feel like I’m losing strength and confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:\n",
    "C: Do you live alone? or is there someone around to help you?\n",
    "P: Yes, I live alone. My daughter works full-time, but she visits me from time to time.\n",
    "C: I see. And how are you feeling right now?\n",

    "P: Mornings are the hardest. My muscles feel stiff and weak when I first wake up.\n",

    "P: I do have a walker, but I often forget to bring it close to the bed, so I end up pushing off with my hands or calling my daughter.\n",
    "C: Has there been a time when you felt unsafe or thought you might fall during these transfers?\n",
    "P: Yes, last week I nearly slipped trying to move from the toilet to my wheelchair.\n",
    "C: Are there any surfaces you find easier, like firmer chairs or raised seats?\n",
    "P: Raised seats definitely help. I added a cushion to my armchair, and that’s made it a bit easier.\n",
    "C: Do you feel like your ability to transfer has changed recently—become more difficult over the past few weeks or months?\n",
    "P: Yes, I’ve noticed it getting worse over the last month or so. I feel like I’m losing strength and confidence.\n",

    "Emotional Feedback:\n",
    "C: Do you live alone? or is there someone around to help you?\n",

    "C: I see. And how are you feeling right now?\n",

    "C: Hi, how are you doing today?  \n",

    "P: We played frisbee fetch. It was fun.  \n",
    "C: That’s good to hear. Sounds like your arms are feeling better lately.  \n",
    "P: Yeah, I’m really able to throw the frisbee now, which is great.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:\n",
    "C: That’s encouraging. Did you feel any discomfort when throwing the frisbee?  \n",
    "P: Just a little. After a few throws, my shoulder felt a bit sore, but nothing like before.  \n",
    "C: Did you notice any limitation in your range of motion when reaching back to throw?  \n",
    "P: A little when I raised my arm overhead. It's not painful, but it feels a bit tight.  \n",
    "C: I see. How about twisting your arm—for example, opening bottles or turning door handles?  \n",
    "P: Doorknobs are fine, but opening bottles is still a bit hard. My wrist doesn’t feel very strong.  \n",
    "C: Got it. What about carrying things like shopping bags or pouring from a kettle?  \n",
    "P: Heavier stuff is still a challenge. I had some trouble lifting a full kettle yesterday.  \n",
    "C: And how about reaching into high cabinets or stretching your arm out to grab things?  \n",
    "P: If I reach too far, especially upward, I feel a pulling near my elbow. So I try not to overdo it.  \n",
    "C: That’s wise. Are there daily activities you’ve had to adapt or take slower?  \n",
    "P: Folding laundry takes longer. Lifting and twisting both arms just wears me out faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:\n",
    "C: How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?  \n",
    "P: Honestly, it’s a relief. A few weeks ago I couldn’t even lift a mug comfortably, so this feels like a big win.  \n",
    "C: That’s great to hear. Do you ever feel discouraged on harder days?  \n",
    "P: Yeah, definitely. Some days my arms feel weaker, and I start worrying that I might be slipping backwards.  \n",
    "C: That’s totally understandable. Have you found anything that helps you stay motivated when that happens?  \n",
    "P: I try to focus on small wins, like managing the laundry or playing with Timo. It reminds me that I’m getting stronger.  \n",
    "C: That’s a great approach. And it sounds like Timo is good at keeping your spirits up.  \n",

    "C: Hi, how are you doing today?  \n",

    "P: We played frisbee fetch. It was fun.  \n",
    "C: That’s good to hear. Sounds like your arms are feeling better lately.  \n",
    "P: Yeah, I’m really able to throw the frisbee now, which is great.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:\n",
    "C: That’s encouraging. Did you feel any discomfort when throwing the frisbee?  \n",
    "P: Just a little. After a few throws, my shoulder felt a bit sore, but nothing like before.  \n",
    "C: Did you notice any limitation in your range of motion when reaching back to throw?  \n",
    "P: A little when I raised my arm overhead. It's not painful, but it feels a bit tight.  \n",
    "C: I see. How about twisting your arm—for example, opening bottles or turning door handles?  \n",
    "P: Doorknobs are fine, but opening bottles is still a bit hard. My wrist doesn’t feel very strong.  \n",
    "C: Got it. What about carrying things like shopping bags or pouring from a kettle?  \n",
    "P: Heavier stuff is still a challenge. I had some trouble lifting a full kettle yesterday.  \n",
    "C: And how about reaching into high cabinets or stretching your arm out to grab things?  \n",
    "P: If I reach too far, especially upward, I feel a pulling near my elbow. So I try not to overdo it.  \n",
    "C: That’s wise. Are there daily activities you’ve had to adapt or take slower?  \n",
    "P: Folding laundry takes longer. Lifting and twisting both arms just wears me out faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:\n",
    "C: How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?  \n",
    "P: Honestly, it’s a relief. A few weeks ago I couldn’t even lift a mug comfortably, so this feels like a big win.  \n",
    "C: That’s great to hear. Do you ever feel discouraged on harder days?  \n",
    "P: Yeah, definitely. Some days my arms feel weaker, and I start worrying that I might be slipping backwards.  \n",
    "C: That’s totally understandable. Have you found anything that helps you stay motivated when that happens?  \n",
    "P: I try to focus on small wins, like managing the laundry or playing with Timo. It reminds me that I’m getting stronger.  \n",
    "C: That’s a great approach. And it sounds like Timo is good at keeping your spirits up.  \n",

    "C: Hi, how are you doing today?  \n",
    "P: I'm doing pretty well. I walked my dog to the park this morning, and we played for a bit.  \n",
    "C: That sounds lovely! What's your dog’s name?  \n",
    "P: His name is Timo.  \n",
    "C: Timo—what a great name! What did you two play?  \n",
    "P: We played frisbee fetch. It was fun.  \n",
    "C: That’s good to hear. Sounds like your arms are feeling better lately.  \n",
    "P: Yeah, I’m really able to throw the frisbee now, which is great.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:\n",
    "C: That’s encouraging. Did you feel any discomfort when throwing the frisbee?  \n",
    "P: Just a little. After a few throws, my shoulder felt a bit sore, but nothing like before.  \n",
    "C: Did you notice any limitation in your range of motion when reaching back to throw?  \n",
    "P: A little when I raised my arm overhead. It's not painful, but it feels a bit tight.  \n",
    "C: I see. How about twisting your arm—for example, opening bottles or turning door handles?  \n",
    "P: Doorknobs are fine, but opening bottles is still a bit hard. My wrist doesn’t feel very strong.  \n",
    "C: Got it. What about carrying things like shopping bags or pouring from a kettle?  \n",
    "P: Heavier stuff is still a challenge. I had some trouble lifting a full kettle yesterday.  \n",
    "C: And how about reaching into high cabinets or stretching your arm out to grab things?  \n",
    "P: If I reach too far, especially upward, I feel a pulling near my elbow. So I try not to overdo it.  \n",
    "C: That’s wise. Are there daily activities you’ve had to adapt or take slower?  \n",
    "P: Folding laundry takes longer. Lifting and twisting both arms just wears me out faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:\n",
    "C: How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?  \n",
    "P: Honestly, it’s a relief. A few weeks ago I couldn’t even lift a mug comfortably, so this feels like a big win.  \n",
    "C: That’s great to hear. Do you ever feel discouraged on harder days?  \n",
    "P: Yeah, definitely. Some days my arms feel weaker, and I start worrying that I might be slipping backwards.  \n",
    "C: That’s totally understandable. Have you found anything that helps you stay motivated when that happens?  \n",
    "P: I try to focus on small wins, like managing the laundry or playing with Timo. It reminds me that I’m getting stronger.  \n",
    "C: That’s a great approach. And it sounds like Timo is good at keeping your spirits up.  \n",
    "P: He really is. He keeps me moving—and smiling.\n",

    "Basic Consultation:\n",
    "C: Hi there! Before we get started, could I have your name and age, please?  \n",
    "P: My name is Voila. I’m 70 years old.  \n",
    "C: No way! You don’t look 70.  \n",
    "P: Aw, thank you! That’s so sweet of you to say.  \n",
    "C: You're very welcome. Now, how can I help you today?  \n",
    "P: Well, my walker isn’t really working for me anymore.  \n",
    "C: I see. Do you want to get a new one, or are you thinking of trying something else?  \n",
    "P: Actually, I think I might need a wheelchair now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:  \n",
    "C: I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be tough. How have you been managing with the walker so far?  \n",
    "P: It’s been okay, but lately I’ve needed more support, especially when I’m outside or walking longer distances.  \n",
    "C: What kind of surfaces are most challenging with the walker—like uneven ground, slopes, or indoors?  \n",
    "P: Pavement with cracks and any uphill sections are really hard. Indoors is a bit easier, but carpets can make the wheels stick.  \n",
    "C: That makes sense. Do you ever find yourself getting stuck or needing to stop and rest?  \n",
    "P: Yes, quite often. I get tired halfway through my block, and my hands start to ache from gripping the handles.  \n",
    "C: Have you tried using any other mobility devices before—like a rollator with a seat or a powered wheelchair?  \n",
    "P: I’ve used a rollator once during rehab, but it was still hard to push. I haven’t tried powered devices yet.  \n",
    "C: What about turning or navigating tight spaces? Has that become more difficult recently?  \n",
    "P: Definitely. I used to be able to make sharp turns in the hallway, but now I bump into the wall or have to back up and try again.  \n",
    "C: And when you go out—like to the grocery store—do you feel comfortable using the walker, or do you hesitate?  \n",
    "P: I’ve started avoiding longer outings unless someone’s with me. I just don’t trust myself to get through them anymore.  \n",
    "C: That’s completely understandable. Based on what you’re describing, a self-propelled or even lightweight wheelchair might offer more stability and less strain.  \n",
    "P: I’ve been thinking the same. I want more freedom to move around, not less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:  \n",
    "C: How are you feeling about needing to make that switch to a wheelchair?  \n",
    "P: Honestly, it’s a little overwhelming. I do not like the fact that I need a wheelchair.  \n",
    "C: That’s a really common feeling. But a lot of people find the right equipment actually helps them feel more in control and confident.  \n",
    "P: I hope so. I’m just afraid it’ll make people see me differently, like I’m fragile.  \n",
    "C: I hear you. But using the right tool for your needs doesn’t change who you are—it just helps you move through life more safely.  \n",
    "P: Yeah, I guess that’s true.  \n",
    "C: Do you have support around you for this transition—family, friends, maybe someone who could help you test out different options?  \n",
    "P: Yes, I have two daughters. They’ve been very encouraging.  \n",
    "C: That’s wonderful to hear. You’re not alone in this, and we’ll work together to find the setup that best supports your independence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basic Consultation:\n",
    "C: Hi there! Before we get started, could I have your name and age, please?  \n",
    "P: My name is Voila. I’m 70 years old.  \n",
    "C: No way! You don’t look 70.  \n",
    "P: Aw, thank you! That’s so sweet of you to say.  \n",
    "C: You're very welcome. Now, how can I help you today?  \n",
    "P: Well, my walker isn’t really working for me anymore.  \n",
    "C: I see. Do you want to get a new one, or are you thinking of trying something else?  \n",
    "P: Actually, I think I might need a wheelchair now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:  \n",
    "C: I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be tough. How have you been managing with the walker so far?  \n",
    "P: It’s been okay, but lately I’ve needed more support, especially when I’m outside or walking longer distances.  \n",
    "C: What kind of surfaces are most challenging with the walker—like uneven ground, slopes, or indoors?  \n",
    "P: Pavement with cracks and any uphill sections are really hard. Indoors is a bit easier, but carpets can make the wheels stick.  \n",
    "C: That makes sense. Do you ever find yourself getting stuck or needing to stop and rest?  \n",
    "P: Yes, quite often. I get tired halfway through my block, and my hands start to ache from gripping the handles.  \n",
    "C: Have you tried using any other mobility devices before—like a rollator with a seat or a powered wheelchair?  \n",
    "P: I’ve used a rollator once during rehab, but it was still hard to push. I haven’t tried powered devices yet.  \n",
    "C: What about turning or navigating tight spaces? Has that become more difficult recently?  \n",
    "P: Definitely. I used to be able to make sharp turns in the hallway, but now I bump into the wall or have to back up and try again.  \n",
    "C: And when you go out—like to the grocery store—do you feel comfortable using the walker, or do you hesitate?  \n",
    "P: I’ve started avoiding longer outings unless someone’s with me. I just don’t trust myself to get through them anymore.  \n",
    "C: That’s completely understandable. Based on what you’re describing, a self-propelled or even lightweight wheelchair might offer more stability and less strain.  \n",
    "P: I’ve been thinking the same. I want more freedom to move around, not less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:  \n",
    "C: How are you feeling about needing to make that switch to a wheelchair?  \n",
    "P: Honestly, it’s a little overwhelming. I do not like the fact that I need a wheelchair.  \n",
    "C: That’s a really common feeling. But a lot of people find the right equipment actually helps them feel more in control and confident.  \n",
    "P: I hope so. I’m just afraid it’ll make people see me differently, like I’m fragile.  \n",
    "C: I hear you. But using the right tool for your needs doesn’t change who you are—it just helps you move through life more safely.  \n",
    "P: Yeah, I guess that’s true.  \n",
    "C: Do you have support around you for this transition—family, friends, maybe someone who could help you test out different options?  \n",
    "P: Yes, I have two daughters. They’ve been very encouraging.  \n",
    "C: That’s wonderful to hear. You’re not alone in this, and we’ll work together to find the setup that best supports your independence.\n",

    "   - Ask about specific situations, task examples, and any environmental or temporal factors that affect performance  \n",
    "   - Clarify the severity and functional impact based on the patient’s narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emotional Feedback and Coping (2–4 turns):**  \n",
    "   - Ask how these challenges make the patient feel (e.g., anxiety, frustration, loss of independence)  \n",
    "   - Explore whether they have any emotional support or coping strategies  \n",
    "   - Encourage hope or future planning when appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Constraints:**\n",
    "- Keep the dialogue **focused entirely on the stated ICF category**. Avoid switching to unrelated domains.\n",
    "- Ensure the patient’s responses match the **given severity level**.\n",
    "- Vary the situations and contexts relevant to this category.\n",
    "- Keep the tone warm, respectful, and reflective of real clinical empathy.\n",

    "**Example (Severe difficulty, Severity 2 – D465):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Consultation:\n",
    "C: Hi there! Before we get started, could I have your name and age, please?  \n",
    "P: My name is Voila. I’m 70 years old.  \n",
    "C: No way! You don’t look 70.  \n",
    "P: Aw, thank you! That’s so sweet of you to say.  \n",
    "C: You're very welcome. Now, how can I help you today?  \n",
    "P: Well, my walker isn’t really working for me anymore.  \n",
    "C: I see. Do you want to get a new one, or are you thinking of trying something else?  \n",
    "P: Actually, I think I might need a wheelchair now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:  \n",
    "C: I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be tough. How have you been managing with the walker so far?  \n",
    "P: It’s been okay, but lately I’ve needed more support, especially when I’m outside or walking longer distances.  \n",
    "C: What kind of surfaces are most challenging with the walker—like uneven ground, slopes, or indoors?  \n",
    "P: Pavement with cracks and any uphill sections are really hard. Indoors is a bit easier, but carpets can make the wheels stick.  \n",
    "C: That makes sense. Do you ever find yourself getting stuck or needing to stop and rest?  \n",
    "P: Yes, quite often. I get tired halfway through my block, and my hands start to ache from gripping the handles.  \n",
    "C: Have you tried using any other mobility devices before—like a rollator with a seat or a powered wheelchair?  \n",
    "P: I’ve used a rollator once during rehab, but it was still hard to push. I haven’t tried powered devices yet.  \n",
    "C: What about turning or navigating tight spaces? Has that become more difficult recently?  \n",
    "P: Definitely. I used to be able to make sharp turns in the hallway, but now I bump into the wall or have to back up and try again.  \n",
    "C: And when you go out—like to the grocery store—do you feel comfortable using the walker, or do you hesitate?  \n",
    "P: I’ve started avoiding longer outings unless someone’s with me. I just don’t trust myself to get through them anymore.  \n",
    "C: That’s completely understandable. Based on what you’re describing, a self-propelled or even lightweight wheelchair might offer more stability and less strain.  \n",
    "P: I’ve been thinking the same. I want more freedom to move around, not less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:  \n",
    "C: How are you feeling about needing to make that switch to a wheelchair?  \n",
    "P: Honestly, it’s a little overwhelming. I do not like the fact that I need a wheelchair.  \n",
    "C: That’s a really common feeling. But a lot of people find the right equipment actually helps them feel more in control and confident.  \n",
    "P: I hope so. I’m just afraid it’ll make people see me differently, like I’m fragile.  \n",
    "C: I hear you. But using the right tool for your needs doesn’t change who you are—it just helps you move through life more safely.  \n",
    "P: Yeah, I guess that’s true.  \n",
    "C: Do you have support around you for this transition—family, friends, maybe someone who could help you test out different options?  \n",
    "P: Yes, I have two daughters. They’ve been very encouraging.  \n",
    "C: That’s wonderful to hear. You’re not alone in this, and we’ll work together to find the setup that best supports your independence.\n",

    "C: Hey, it’s been a while. How have you been feeling lately?  \n",

    "P: No, we took the train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:  \n",
    "C: I see. How was the train ride overall?  \n",
    "P: Pretty smooth, honestly. We even managed to find seats near the door, so it was convenient.  \n",
    "C: That’s great. Did you have any difficulty boarding or exiting the train?  \n",
    "P: Just a bit. The step between the platform and the train was a little high.  \n",
    "C: And once inside, was it easy to move through the aisle and find your seat?  \n",
    "P: Yes, though the aisle was narrow. I had to move slowly to avoid bumping into other passengers.  \n",
    "C: What about carrying your luggage? Were you able to manage that without help?  \n",
    "P: I had a small suitcase with wheels, so it was fine on flat surfaces. My wife helped lift it onto the luggage rack.  \n",
    "C: How did you find the station itself? Was it easy to navigate through, especially during peak hours?  \n",
    "P: The signage was clear, but during busy times, I had to be extra careful not to get jostled. It can be a bit overwhelming.  \n",
    "C: Did you use any connecting transport, like a bus or tram, after arriving?  \n",
    "P: Yes, we took a tram to the hotel. It was low-floor, so getting on and off was easy.  \n",
    "C: That’s good. Were there any unexpected delays or changes in route?  \n",
    "P: There was a minor delay on the way back, but nothing serious. We just waited an extra 10 minutes.  \n",
    "C: It sounds like you handled it well. Do you usually check the transport schedules ahead of time?  \n",
    "P: Always. I use an app to plan the route and check platform changes. It makes things much smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:  \n",
    "C: How did you feel about the trip overall? Did everything go as you expected?  \n",
    "P: It was a great trip. I mean, I can still get around, and trains are convenient, so I really can’t complain.  \n",
    "C: That’s great to hear. Do you feel like using public transportation gives you enough independence?  \n",
    "P: In some ways, yes. I don’t need to rely on others to drive me, which is nice.  \n",
    "C: That makes sense. Do you ever feel anxious about crowded stations or transfers?  \n",
    "P: Occasionally, especially if I have to switch lines quickly. But with a bit of planning, I feel in control.  \n",
    "C: That’s a very balanced perspective. Sounds like you’ve developed a system that works for you.  \n",
    "P: Yes, and it helps me stay active and connected with people and places outside home.\n",

    "C: Hey, it’s been a while. How have you been feeling lately?  \n",

    "P: It was really fun. It’s been a long time since I last traveled, so it felt great to get away for a bit.  \n",

    "P: No, we took the train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:  \n",
    "C: I see. How was the train ride overall?  \n",
    "P: Pretty smooth, honestly. We even managed to find seats near the door, so it was convenient.  \n",
    "C: That’s great. Did you have any difficulty boarding or exiting the train?  \n",
    "P: Just a bit. The step between the platform and the train was a little high.  \n",
    "C: And once inside, was it easy to move through the aisle and find your seat?  \n",
    "P: Yes, though the aisle was narrow. I had to move slowly to avoid bumping into other passengers.  \n",
    "C: What about carrying your luggage? Were you able to manage that without help?  \n",
    "P: I had a small suitcase with wheels, so it was fine on flat surfaces. My wife helped lift it onto the luggage rack.  \n",
    "C: How did you find the station itself? Was it easy to navigate through, especially during peak hours?  \n",
    "P: The signage was clear, but during busy times, I had to be extra careful not to get jostled. It can be a bit overwhelming.  \n",
    "C: Did you use any connecting transport, like a bus or tram, after arriving?  \n",
    "P: Yes, we took a tram to the hotel. It was low-floor, so getting on and off was easy.  \n",
    "C: That’s good. Were there any unexpected delays or changes in route?  \n",
    "P: There was a minor delay on the way back, but nothing serious. We just waited an extra 10 minutes.  \n",
    "C: It sounds like you handled it well. Do you usually check the transport schedules ahead of time?  \n",
    "P: Always. I use an app to plan the route and check platform changes. It makes things much smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:  \n",
    "C: How did you feel about the trip overall? Did everything go as you expected?  \n",
    "P: It was a great trip. I mean, I can still get around, and trains are convenient, so I really can’t complain.  \n",
    "C: That’s great to hear. Do you feel like using public transportation gives you enough independence?  \n",
    "P: In some ways, yes. I don’t need to rely on others to drive me, which is nice.  \n",
    "C: That makes sense. Do you ever feel anxious about crowded stations or transfers?  \n",
    "P: Occasionally, especially if I have to switch lines quickly. But with a bit of planning, I feel in control.  \n",
    "C: That’s a very balanced perspective. Sounds like you’ve developed a system that works for you.  \n",

    "P: I’ve been feeling well, thanks! I actually just got back from a short trip.  \n",
    "C: That sounds great! Where did you go?  \n",
    "P: My wife and I went to Groningen.  \n",
    "C: Nice! How was the trip?  \n",
    "P: It was really fun. It’s been a long time since I last traveled, so it felt great to get away for a bit.  \n",
    "C: That’s wonderful! Did you drive there yourselves?  \n",
    "P: No, we took the train.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Follow-up:  \n",
    "C: I see. How was the train ride overall?  \n",
    "P: Pretty smooth, honestly. We even managed to find seats near the door, so it was convenient.  \n",
    "C: That’s great. Did you have any difficulty boarding or exiting the train?  \n",
    "P: Just a bit. The step between the platform and the train was a little high.  \n",
    "C: And once inside, was it easy to move through the aisle and find your seat?  \n",
    "P: Yes, though the aisle was narrow. I had to move slowly to avoid bumping into other passengers.  \n",
    "C: What about carrying your luggage? Were you able to manage that without help?  \n",
    "P: I had a small suitcase with wheels, so it was fine on flat surfaces. My wife helped lift it onto the luggage rack.  \n",
    "C: How did you find the station itself? Was it easy to navigate through, especially during peak hours?  \n",
    "P: The signage was clear, but during busy times, I had to be extra careful not to get jostled. It can be a bit overwhelming.  \n",
    "C: Did you use any connecting transport, like a bus or tram, after arriving?  \n",
    "P: Yes, we took a tram to the hotel. It was low-floor, so getting on and off was easy.  \n",
    "C: That’s good. Were there any unexpected delays or changes in route?  \n",
    "P: There was a minor delay on the way back, but nothing serious. We just waited an extra 10 minutes.  \n",
    "C: It sounds like you handled it well. Do you usually check the transport schedules ahead of time?  \n",
    "P: Always. I use an app to plan the route and check platform changes. It makes things much smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Feedback:  \n",
    "C: How did you feel about the trip overall? Did everything go as you expected?  \n",
    "P: It was a great trip. I mean, I can still get around, and trains are convenient, so I really can’t complain.  \n",
    "C: That’s great to hear. Do you feel like using public transportation gives you enough independence?  \n",
    "P: In some ways, yes. I don’t need to rely on others to drive me, which is nice.  \n",
    "C: That makes sense. Do you ever feel anxious about crowded stations or transfers?  \n",
    "P: Occasionally, especially if I have to switch lines quickly. But with a bit of planning, I feel in control.  \n",
    "C: That’s a very balanced perspective. Sounds like you’ve developed a system that works for you.  \n",
    "P: Yes, and it helps me stay active and connected with people and places outside home.\n",
