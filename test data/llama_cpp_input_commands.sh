I’ve been having issues opening and closing my car door.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** That’s annoying. Has this always been an issue or could you first do so with ease.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** Despite its size, it used to be rather easy. It’s only a bit heavier than any other car door.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** What changed? Do you feel as if you have lost the strength?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** In general, yes, but I notice it most when trying to open or close my car door. With both movements I can manage the first part, but then I have to twist my shoulder in a way that makes it hard to generate enough strength to continue.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** Are you capable to reposition your body to be able to produce the strength from another position?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** I have tried but 9 out of 10 times there are other parked cars that are in the way.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** So, how did you open and close your door today, I didn’t see when I glanced outside.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** My son is with me, he is in the waiting room. I try and drag him along everywhere I go so that he can give the extra little push or pull I need.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** I see. That sounds frustrating. How does it feel emotionally when something as simple as opening a car door becomes difficult?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** It’s humiliating, people stare when I struggle to close my door. I never thought something so small would feel like such a hurdle.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** I’m sorry that you have to go through that. Do you find yourself avoiding situations because of it?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** Sometimes. For example, with groceries, when I see that the parking lot is full, I decide to just go back home and go another day to avoid the embarrassment of people seeing me struggle open and close my car door.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"

I was able to walk at home a bit with the help of my son, but recently I feel a lot weaker and I need my wheelchair for basically everything. But it is not convenient at home at all. For getting in and out of the wheelchair I depend on my son 100%.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** I see that. Are you able to do anything with the wheelchair by yourself?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** I can't. I feel like my legs and arms are too weak to get me up. Especially if where I sit or lie is low, I don't have strength to stand up on my own.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** I see. So we will need to work on your strength, so you will be less dependant on your son.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** That sounds like a good plan. I am sick of feeling so weak.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** That's good to know. You mentioned you live with your partner, has she been helpful?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** I can't live without her now. Thank god he's still strong, but he has bad eyesight. We are supporting each other.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"

Do you not trust the steadiness of your rollator or is the pain that strong that you get scared?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** Maybe pain is the wrong word. It is more a new uncomfortable feeling and yes the rollator has wheels so I don't trust that he holds my weight while sitting down.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** Okay, I see. I will show you how much you can trust the rollator, because trust me, the brakes are amazing and then you don't need the help of the nurse anymore and you are only dependant on the rollator.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** That would be so great, because then I don't need to wait so long to go to the toilet.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n** Do you have any help at home?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n** No, I live still alone because my wife just passed away and before I could move in an appartement where there is help, I had to go to the hospital.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
