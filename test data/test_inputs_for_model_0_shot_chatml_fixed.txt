P: Hello. My day was quite nice except for one thing.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Can I ask you what went wrong?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Sounds great. Thank you so much.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I try to slowly lean forward with the help of my rollator and get into kinda a squatting position and then I would feel a bit of pain and with that I am not comfortable so I ask the nurse to help me sit down.

P: Of course. I have a bit of trouble getting from standing back on my bed into sitting. And I don't wanna ask the nurses for help, because it is so much better than the days before, but I need a tiny bit more help.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

C: That is lovely to hear. Would you mind telling me what makes it difficult for you?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Of course not. I am quite uncomfortable with bending my upper body, so going to on side is a bit harsh on my body and I don't know how I can lay down in any other way.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Is it more the bending to the front, side ot back that is harsh on your body?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I think the bending to the side is the most problematic. As soon as I do it, I tense up and then I rather ask the nurse for help, then trying it on my own again. I am quite sure I could do it on my own. Just my head is a bit in the way still.
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
C: Is it your right or left hand? I assume it is your dominant side?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Yes. My dominant hand is my left. It was fine picking up a cup to trink, but as soon as the object was tinier, I could not grab it anymore. My fingers start trembeling and I can't controle the movements anymore. So frustrating.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I understand. Are you able to carry bigger objects, like your phone?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Phone yes, but not things that are heavier. Then I need to use my right hand or I need to ask for help. I feel like when I use my left hand more the symptoms will get worse and I don't wanna go back to where I was not able to use it at all.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I'm doing pretty well. I walked my dog to the park this morning, and we played for a bit.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: That sounds nice! What's your dog's name?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: His name is Timo.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: We palyed frisbee fetch. It was fun.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: That’s good! Sounds like your arms are feeling much better now.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Yes, they are. I am really able to throw the frisbee now
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: That’s good to hear. So, did you feel any discomfort when throwing the frisbee?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Just a little. After a few throws, my shoulder felt a bit sore, but nowhere near as bad as before.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: That’s a good sign! How about your grip? Did you feel like you had a solid hold on the frisbee?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Yeah, my grip felt a lot better. I used to struggle with holding onto things for too long, but today I barely noticed it.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: That’s progress! What about other activities, like carrying groceries or opening jars? Are those getting any easier too?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Yeah, I’d say so. Lifting heavy bags is still a bit challenging, but I don’t feel as much strain in my arms as before. And opening jars—I still have to put in some effort, but it’s not as frustrating now.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: How does it feel seeing some progress?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Honestly, it feels like a relief. It’s been tough not being able to do things like I used to, but now I’m starting to feel like I’m getting back on track.

<|im_start|>user
P: At rest, I don't feel anything most of the time, during exercise, especially mobilization, it can be 4-5. Is that normal?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: It's 4 weeks after surgery. I'd say it's pretty normal. Has it gotten any better?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: That's for sure. Pain level decreased compared to post-surgery day. Now it's the rehab program triggering the pain. I can deal with it though. I think it's necessary. I'm just whining here.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: You feelings are absolutely valid. And you're rigtht, that this process is not too pleasant, but you'll see the good result. Does your wrist cause any emotional changes?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: More or less. It's my dominant hand you know. I don't know if I can go back to the previous stage after rehab.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I understand your worries. As long as you keep rehab programs, and check with you PT regularly. I'm pretty positive you'll be on the right track.

P: I don’t feel comfortable and strong with it. I cannot walk longer than 10 minutes with that. I’m getting so exhausted after 10 m.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: OK you feel not comfortable because you feel weak or there is something related to you. You’re not familiar how to use that.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: both I’m not really happy with it and also I’m feeling weak and unsafe with that. And I was wondering why you did not provide me a wheelchair?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Shahr wheelchair is an option and we can switch to wheelchair but being active after surgery. It’s quite important for you.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: OK, I understand, but I have enough difficulties after surgery and I don’t want more challenge to be deal with if you can change it to wheelchair. I will be happy.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: sure I will ask for a wheelchair for you and also report to the nurse. Hopefully that makes you happier.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P:  yes that would be great. You know I have been in the hospital for three weeks now and I am feeling already depressed and any any extra challenge that makes me so happy.

<|im_end|>

<|im_end|>

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Like everyday, kinda alright.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Why not totally alright?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Because a friend of mine died and I want to go to the funeral, but nobody can drive me and I can't go by train.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I am so sorry to hear that. Why can't you use the train?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Because the gap is too big for me.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: You can ask for mobility support and then the staff will provide a ramp for you.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: What is the biggest problem for you when you use the train?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I am dependind on someone to bring my walker with me, because I am so unstable everywhere. The gap is too big for me and my walker and I can't carry it up the stairs.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: So you need your walker for everything and the train is too much of a hustle?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Yes, exactly.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: If you would be in the train, would you be able to move around freely?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: If you mean by freely with my walker, then yes. But at the moment it is vacation time and way too many people are in the train for me to walk with my walker.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I see your point.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Is it hard for you to depend on other people?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I despise it. Especially in the public, I depend on people I don't know. I just have to trust random people. They could rob me.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I think most people are kind and willing to help. Robbing is an extreme example.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: That is true. But still a possibility.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Do you have people around you that take care of you?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Not really, because my wife recently passed away, so I am really on my mind.

<|im_start|>assistant
C: Glad that nothing worse happened. How long have you been using the wheelchair?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Not that long. For like 3 months. It should not be broken. I still have guarantee on it.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Very good, so as soon as they fix it you will have your normal routine back. Should I help you with anything until they are here?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: That would be nice. Maybe you can hold my wheelchair as long as I put makeup on so I don't accidently stab my eye with the mascara.
<|im_end|>

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: It is really fucked. I am just getting used to the fact that I have to use a wheelchair as a help. And now it is broken. I just got the hang of it. And now I need help again. It is soooo annoying.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I can understand that. Do you need extra help?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: That would be great. Because the mechanics didn't have the right breaks for my model so they ordered it online. They will arrive in 3 days.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I will inform the building and they will send someone to check on you every hour to see if you need help.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

<|im_start|>assistant
C: That is very smart. Do you use it mostly for the security of it or also for the support of your body weight.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I manage getting around, but I get wobbly on corners and when I change direction.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: So, your walker provides sufficient support, but turning and balancing remain challenging?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: Exactly. I can get from the living room to the kitchen, but I have to stop and steady myself several times.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: Understood. Would you say that stopping to regain balance is your main difficulty?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: How do you feel about your condition?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: I’m scared to death. I had a nightmare where I fell whilst using my walker. That can’t be sign that it’ll actually happen right?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
C: I’m sure it was just a nightmare. With the right approach we can improve your ability to more around with your walker.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
P: That’s all I want. I want to move more freely. I have had enough of all this worriment
