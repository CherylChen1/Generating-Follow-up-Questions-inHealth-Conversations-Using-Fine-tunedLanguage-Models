Is it okay if I ask you some additional questions before we start our training session?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: That’s okay.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: After a stroke, I imagine a lot changes in one’s life. How have you experienced this?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: I definitely started taking my health more seriously. I’m just so grateful that it was a small stroke. I would hate to be in a wheelchair.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: Have you changed your lifestyle at all after the stroke?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: I immediately started eating healthier since my high cholesterol was the most likely culprit of my stroke.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant",

Parkinson is in my family history.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: You are the expert. How has it been for you after the visit?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: You know I love skating. Every Friday night I joined the stakting gathering in Utrecht. I could always make a show for everyone. But not anymore.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: I can imagine how tough it must be for you.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: Yes. I used to go to work by skating. Now I can't skate without someone walking by my side. I can still skate, but my legs are out of control sometimes.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: It's safer to have someone by your side. How long has it been?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: A year ago. It was during skating when I noticed something went wrong. After that, everything went down quicly. I felt unconfident to make skilful moves at first, and then regular skating became hard to control too. Imagine, within one year.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: I feel for you. Could you describe your symptoms?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: Now I have all those classic symptoms, tremors, bradykinesia. I haven't been shuffling though, but I guess that won't be far away.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: Does these new changes haev any emotional impact on you?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nP: I can't say no. This is big change to my life, but I was well-prepared. It's in my genes. My father and grandfather all suffered from a quickly-developed Parkinson's.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nC: It's good that you're prepared.
