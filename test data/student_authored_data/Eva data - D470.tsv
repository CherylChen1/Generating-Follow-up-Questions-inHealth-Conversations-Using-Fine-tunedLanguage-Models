Using transportation D470	1	C: Hello xxx, how have you been lately? P: I'm doing great. C: Glad to know. Have you met any difficulties recently? P: Now that you mentioined, yes, actually, I started to go around to visit some old frientds, and I tried to take trains, but it was impossible for me. C: What problem did you meet? P: I couldn't get on the train by myself.	C: I'm sorry about that. Could you give me more information about why you were not able to get on the train? P: I wheelchair around when I'm outside of my house. I can go almost anywhere, but I couldn't lift my wheelchair onto the train. There are 2 or 3 flyers of stairs there.  C: I see. It must be too heavy for you. P: Exactly, It's already hard work for me to be standing and walking. How am I supposed to lift up a wheelchair? C: Right. It is quite heavy. What about with someone's help? P: I guess so, but I can't expect there would be someone always standing by the door to help me out.	C: That's very true. How are you dealing with that situation mentally? P: I can't get on the train by myself, fair, I can accept the fact, but still, it's frustrating. Is the government doing anything to improve the life of us? C: You're right. Are you frustrated because the government could have done a better job? P: Yes, they took our money and they should. C: I agree. So you're not satisfied with the adaptation of train. Other than that, how do you generally feel about your life? P: My life is good. You see, I still have the energy to meet my friends at least.
Using transportation D470	2	C: Good afternoon, sir. How's your day? P: Thanks for asking. It's a dunny day, so good for me. C: Same here. Sunshine always brightens my mood. Do you have any complaints? about your body, about your life? P: Yes. It's difficult for my wife to push my wheelchair. C: Sorry about that. Do you live with you wife? P: Yes, and she's the only one who can push me around every day.	C: What made it difficult for her? P: She has dementia, and it's geting worse. C: Sorry to hear about that. I assume you have a manual wheelchair, right? P: Yes, that's why I need her. She's strong enough to push, but sometimes she doesn't know what she's doing. very forgetful. C: Is she able to help you when she's herself? P: Yes, but the time of she knowing who she is and who I am is getting less and less. She once asked me how many kids we have, and started counting, and came up with a wrong answer.	C: How do you feel about that? P: I laughed. haha. but of course, it's harsh when she doesn't even remember me. C: It must be difficult for you. How are you coping with that feeling? P: I just keep telling myself it's a natural process of the pathology. Nothing against me, nothing personal. But still. i would take it personal. I can't stop thinking why she would forget about me. Maybe one day, I should tell her a story about who she is everyday, like the movie The Note. C: You're right that this is only a natural process. P: Always easier said than done.
Using transportation D470	3	C: Hi there, this is PT Johnson, are you available to have a talk now? P: Hi Johnson, nice to hear from you. Go ahead. C: Great. How have you been lately? P: Not bad. My eldest kid has come to stayed with for holiday. We're enjoying out time. C: Good to know! Life's been great for you! Let know if there anything bothering you currently. P: As you know, I live by the river, and I had to ride a small boat to the shore if I want to go anywhere. Now I find it unsafe to get on the boat.  	C: Why do you feel unsafe? P: When I step on the boat, it shakes a bit, and I felt loss of control. It's scary, I never felt this before. C: How long has it been? P: a month or so. I almost fell once. After that, I had to have someone holding my hand until I find my balance on the boat. C: What about after you get on the boat? Any discomfort? P: All good. I mean I probably can't stand still on a moving boat, but I don't have to. Just going on and off the boat is a problem, I need someone to help now.	C: I see. How do you feel about this change? P: It's vey inconvenient. And I don't like it, as, like, this is a sign of me getting older? C: It doesn't have to be. P: If you say so, but still I wonder, is there anything I can do about this? C: Absolutely. We can schedule a visit and see what we can do to get you back on the boat safely. P: Great. Do not go gentle into that good night. I still wanna try.
Using transportation D470	4	C: Hi Mr. M, how are you today? P: Nothing special. C: You mentioned last time you had difficulty getting on and off the boat. Are you feeling any better?  P: Much better, I'd say. I did some trainings. C: That's good to know. How long have you been training? P: 2 months. about three times a day. As suggested by the physiotherapist.	C: Congratulaitions, you've achieved a lot. Would you describe to me how you are getting on and off now? P: Of course. So when I step onto the boat, it was from a higher platform to a lower one. And my supporting leg was getting weaker, so I always lower my body too quickly. C: I see. Is that why you lost your balance? P: Exactly. So after training, I had better control. And could lower down slowly. C: Would you say you're totally able to get on your boat on your own now. P: Not really, I still need someone to stand next to me. So I can reach to him when I feel I'm losing balance. And sometimes I do. It'd be too risky otherwise.	C: How do you see you current progress? P: I'm basically satisfied. But of course it could be even better if I don't need anyone else to help. C: You're right. And happy to see that you're making progress. P: Maybe I should keep training and see if I can improve my balance. C: If you're motivated, I'm sure you can still improve. P: I'm very optimistic about that.
Using transportation D470	5	C: Good moring Mr. M, is everything going OK? P: Hi, nice to have you calling again. It's been great. C: Good to know that everything's great. Did you get better with your boat riding? P: Yes and no. C: Oh, why's that? P: I made some adaptations.	C: What kind of adaptations? P: I setup a rail next to the steps, so that I have something to hold on to when I get on and off the boat. C: It sounds helpful for you. P: It is, for sure, it is. It's just, I realized I'm not getting any better with trainings. I still feel I could lose my balance when I step on my boat. And I always have to ride a boat to the land. So you know, it's safer to make some adaptations. C: I agree. You're right. Do you still have difficulty with the hand rail? P: Not at all. I could go on and off freely. No one has to be wathing over me.	C: That's great news! How do you feel about that? P: Not very well. I did strength trainings, some balance trainings. I thought I should be able to go back to what I was capable of, but I didn't. C: I understand. It's a natural process, but the good side is, you're don't have any troubles with using the boat. P: Yes, there's the bright side, but it also means I'm really old now, that I need help with getting on the boat. That feeling sucks. I've spent my life traveling by boat. And now I'm not able to step on the boat without assistance. What's next? I probably can't sit still on the boat. C: I see your concern, but... P: I know it's more important to be able to use the boat, with adaptations or no, but do you understand this feeling, even if I did everything I could, growing older and weaker is simply inevitable.
