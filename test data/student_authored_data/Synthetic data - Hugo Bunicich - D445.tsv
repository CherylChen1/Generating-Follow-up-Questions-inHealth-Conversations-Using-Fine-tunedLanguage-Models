Hand and arm use D445	1	C: Hello, I’m Greg, I’m your physiotherapist for today. P: My name is Sheila, nice to meet you. C: How are we doing today. P: Horrible. I’m so glad I finally got a meeting with you. I need serious help. C: Please, tell me, what’s going on? P: I can’t even get my front door open.	C: Can you tell me more about that? P: I try to turn the doorknob, but my hand just won’t grip or twist. C: Is there also pain or any tingling sensations in the hand or wrist? P: A bit of both yes. C: Have you had this for a long time? P: Yes for 3 months C: 3 months? That’s a long time. How have you been entering and leaving your house? P: I live in a good neighborhood so I just leave the door open a crack. But unfortunately, the last time I did that someone walked inside and stole some stuff.	C: That’s awful, I’m sorry to hear that. P: Thank you. C: Why is it that you chose to handle your wrist pain in this manner? Were you too busy to come see a physio? P: No, I just didn’t think that my condition was serious enough to have looked at. People suffer from so much worse. C: Not being able to turn your doorknob to enter your house is a definite red flag.   P: Ah, I see, so I should have come earlier? C: Yes definitely. Now, let me take a look at your hand and wrist. P: Yes, please do.
Hand and arm use D445	2	C: Hello, my name is Ben, what’s your name? P: My name is Sam C: How old are you Sam? P: 52 C: I saw you drive into the clinic’s parking lot, you’ve got quite a sizable vehicle.  P: Well, funnily enough, it’s my car I’ve been having issues with. I’ve been having issues opening and closing my car door.	C: That’s annoying. Has this always been an issue or could you first do so with ease. P: Despite its size, it used to be rather easy. It’s only a bit heavier than any other car door. C: What changed? Do you feel as if you have lost the strength? P: In general, yes, but I notice it most when trying to open or close my car door. With both movements I can manage the first part, but then I have to twist my shoulder in a way that makes it hard to generate enough strength to continue. C: Are you capable to reposition your body to be able to produce the strength from another position? P: I have tried but 9 out of 10 times there are other parked cars that are in the way. C: So, how did you open and close your door today, I didn’t see when I glanced outside. P: My son is with me, he is in the waiting room. I try and drag him along everywhere I go so that he can give the extra little push or pull I need.	C: I see. That sounds frustrating. How does it feel emotionally when something as simple as opening a car door becomes difficult? P: It’s humiliating, people stare when I struggle to close my door. I never thought something so small would feel like such a hurdle. C: I’m sorry that you have to go through that. Do you find yourself avoiding situations because of it? P: Sometimes. For example, with groceries, when I see that the parking lot is full, I decide to just go back home and go another day to avoid the embarrassment of people seeing me struggle open and close my car door. C: Thank you for sharing that. We’ll make it our goal to find ways to make these tasks feel manageable again. P: I’d really like that. I don’t want to keep feeling this limited.
Hand and arm use D445	3	C: Hi Helen, long time no see, how are the children? P: Hey, they’re doing good, I’m glad you were able to fit me in so late notice. C: No worries, one of my clients ended up canceling, freeing up a slot. What can I do for you? P: 2 months ago, I had surgery on my shoulder and ever since then I have been having some issues.  C: I’m sorry to hear that, what happened to your shoulder? P: I tore my labrum throwing a baseball. C: Ouch, that must’ve been quite painful. What issues are you running into? P: To name one, it’s been difficult brushing my teeth.	C: What makes it that brushing your teeth is difficult.  P: I constantly need to take breaks. After about 30 seconds I stop and resume after another 30 seconds. C: Do you require breaks due to pain? P: I wouldn’t call it pain, it’s more like a deep fatigue in the shoulder. C: During the break, what do you do with the arm? Do you just let it hang by your side? P: I prop my elbow on the sink. It helps a bit, but it still takes me double the time it used to.	C: How has this impacted your life? P: It wears on me. It makes me feel older than I actually am. But I’m determined to keep doing it myself. C: I feel for you. It is good that you’re still determined. If it’s alright with you can you take your shirt off so that I can look at the shoulder. I’ll be doing some tests P: No problem at all.
Hand and arm use D445	4	C: Hi Mr. Reynolds, how are you. P: Hey, Tom, I’m doing better and better every day. I’m currently also on paternity leave. My wife and I recently had a baby boy. C: That’s wonderful news. Congratulations to both of you! I had no clue you two were expecting a child. How’s fatherhood treating you so far? P: Thank you! It’s been amazing, even though the lack of sleep is definitely catching up to me, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It’s also been a perfect opportunity to spend more time with my 8-year-old son. C: That is nice. What have you been doing with your 8-year-old. P: We’ve been playing a lot of baseball. Yesterday we tossed a ball back and forth in the backyard.  C: How did you manage? P: Just some minor hiccups.	C: That’s great to hear. Could you elaborate on the hiccups? Were you not able to keep up with him? P: Oh, I kept up alright. But I’ll admit, after five or six throws, my shoulder started to feel a little sore.  C: Did the soreness stop you from continuing? P: No, nothing like that. I just took it a bit slower. We still played for a good half hour. C: Sounds like you're managing well, just with some mild discomfort. P: Exactly. It's not ideal, but it doesn’t really hold me back. I just need to ice it afterward. C: That’s perfectly in line with what I’d expect. P: Okay, that’s good.	C: How are you doing emotionally? I imagine this time has brought a wide range of highs and lows. P: The shoulder injury was definitely one of the lows—I was terrified I wouldn’t be able to hold my newborn. But here I am, not only managing just fine, but even playing catch in the yard. Emotionally, I feel better than ever. C: That makes me so happy. Let’s keep strengthening the shoulder so you can keep enjoying those moments with your children. P: That’s the goal I want to keep playing catch with him as long as I can. And once his little brother’s old enough, I hope to do the same with him too.
Hand and arm use D445	5	C: Hey, it’s wonderful seeing you again! P: Its nice seeing you too. How have you been? C: I’ve been doing well. Just busy in the clinic. P: As all ways. C: How have you been since our last session? How has the gardening been? P: Effortlessly, I’m a changed woman since you’ve last seen me.	C: Please tell me more. P: I managed every task without a hitch. P: How did you find turning the water faucet and pulling the hose around the flower beds? P: No problem at all, my grip was strong, and the hose moved easily. C: That’s excellent. What about those stubborn pickle jars you’ve been having trouble with. Are they easier to open now? P: Absolutely, I finally have enough grip to open them properly.	C: That’s great! I’m happy you’re back doing what you love.  P: Me too, it hurt so much seeing my plants die merely because I couldn’t water them properly. C: I’m so pleased for you. Let’s keep working on that grip strength to keep you at peak performance. P: Sounds good to me!
