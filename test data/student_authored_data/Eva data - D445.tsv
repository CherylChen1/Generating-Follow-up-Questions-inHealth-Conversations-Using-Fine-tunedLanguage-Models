P: There're so many things I can't do now. Like it was a bit difficult for me to write properly. C: Why was it difficult? P: My right fingers don't listen to me.	C: i assume right is your dominant side? P: Yes. It was fine to pick up my phone, but as I tried to write, my fingers trembles. Now the handwritings are unreadable. C: I see. Are you able to carry, for example, groceries? P: Not too heavy. I avoid using my left arm because I had a shoulder replacement sugery years ago, but I'm still worried about carrying heavy stuff. You know, my arms can be ripped off again,  C: I understand you concern, you had a surgery for that already. P : Exactly, And after the surgery, my sholder became very stiff. I can't raise my arm over sholder anymore. It's also weaker than the other side.	C: Does this situation affect you emotionally? P: It's frustrating for sure, but it's not the end of the world. I can still move around. C: Good to know. Do you live by yourself or with your family? P: I live with my partner. We help each other out at this stage. She can still cook for us. She's my support.  C: I'm sure she is. Do you have kids? P: We have a daughter and two sons. My daughter lives nearby. We have dinner together every week.

C: Are you able to use you injured side now? P: I don't use it to do anything, but I started some light weight trainings as advised. It was stiff after casting, and sometimes painful. C: How much would you rate your pain level from 0 to 10, during exercise and rest? P: At rest, I don't feel anything most of the time, during exercise, especially mobilization, it can be 4-5. Is that normal? C: It's 4 weeks after surgery. I'd say it's pretty normal. Has it gotten any better? P: That's for sure. Pain level decreased compared to post-surgery day. Now it's the rehab program triggering the pain. I can deal with it though. I think it's necessary. I'm just whining here.	C: You feelings are absolutely valid. And you're rigtht, that this process is not too pleasant, but you'll see the good result. Does your wrist cause any emotional changes? P: More or less. It's my dominant hand you know.

I'm pretty positive you'll be on the right track. P: Hmmm, we'll see. C: Is there anyone living with you, who can help you a bit? P: No, I'm all alone. I have my left hand to help.

But my sports performance is affected.	C: What kind of sports? How is it affected? P: I play badminton and volley ball, as you can imagine, the overhead movements are very important, but now I don't have the flexibility to that. C: I can imagine, these movements can be challenging. What is it that made you feel difficult? P: The stiffness. I feel like there's glue inside my shoulder, It's hard for me to raise my arm up high. Turning my lowerarm backwards is even more difficult. C: Do you still play badminton and volleyball? P I do, but mainly focus on underhead shots. I can't hit back the ball with overhead movement.	C: Thank you for your information. What's your feeling towards this change? P: I can't compete anymore. This is not a pleasant feeling.  C: I understand. P: I really miss the way I used to play.

Hand and arm use D445	4	C: Hello Jim, this is Sandy. How is it going recently? P: Hi Sandy. As usual, nothing special. C: Is there anything troubling you recently? P: Not really. It's been fine. Just maybe my right hand, is not not as 灵活 as it used to be. C: Would you elaborate on that? P: Sure. I think it's weaker, especially the fingers. I can't wirte small characters. My fingers trembles.	C: So can you still write? P: Yes, but only bigger characters, and you see, the lines are a bit twisted. I can't control my fingers. C: I'm sorry about that. How long has it been? P: I think it's been a while, but I'm sure. I also had issues with typing. Same, I can still type, but the speed and accuracy has dropped. It's also more difficult to type on the digital screen. C: Do you have any other complaints with your right hand or fingers? P: I think mainly the fine control, that doesn't take too much strength is affected. I can still turn the key, although I feel weaker, but controling that movement is not a problem.	C: Glad to learn that. How does this problem that make you feel? P: It's inconvenient, but I don't have to write or type a lot. C: That's right. P: Of course it would be better with no problem at all, but hey, I'm 70 years old. I don't complain about that. C: You are very healthy at your age. P: I'm grateful for that.

P: After half a year of rehab, my wrist is back to normal.	C: Wow, that's indeed great news! P: I was so worried after the injury. And it has been weak for such a long time. I almost lost my hope. C: But you did it! Do you still have any difficulties using your injured wrist? P: Nope. Well, it's the left side, so the tested strength outcome is weaker than the right side, but left is expected to be weaker right? There's no noticeable difference for me. C: That's good to know. So I assume you can do everything with your left hand, like lifting groceries, pushing doors open? P: Oh, better than that, I can do push-ups. I also resumed my boxing trainings, although I'm being careful now. Imagine, I was trying so hard to turn the key at the beginning.	C: You've come so far. Congratulations!
