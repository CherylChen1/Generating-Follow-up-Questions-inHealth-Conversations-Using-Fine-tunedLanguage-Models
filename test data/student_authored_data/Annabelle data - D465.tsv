Moving around using equipment D465	1	C: Good day Anna, how are you managing today? P: So bad. I don't wanna talk about it. Horrible morning and even worse afternoon.  C: That sounds concerning. What happened? P: Something is broken in my wheelchair. And I need it! It needs to be fixed! Like now.  C: Did you call the people that can fix it? What exactly is broken? P: Yes, they are on their way. My brakes are broken. I am constantly moving and like that I can't chill or even get out of my wheelchair because it is not stable at all. 	C: I am sorry to hear that. Did anything happen to you? P: Not yet, thank god. But I almost broke a glass when I couldn't stop while picking it up to drink something ebcause the chair just rolled backwards.  C: Glad that nothing worse happened. How long have you been using the wheelchair? P: Not that long. For like 3 months. It should not be broken. I still have guarantee on it.  C: Very good, so as soon as they fix it you will have your normal routine back. Should I help you with anything until they are here? P: That would be nice. Maybe you can hold my wheelchair as long as I put makeup on so I don't accidently stab my eye with the mascara. C: Of course. I will be your breaks for the next minutes, haha.	C: How are you feeling about the broken brakes? P: It is really fucked. I am just getting used to the fact that I have to use a wheelchair as a help. And now it is broken. I just got the hang of it. And now I need help again. It is soooo annoying.  C: I can understand that. Do you need extra help? P: That would be great. Because the mechanics didn't have the right breaks for my model so they ordered it online. They will arrive in 3 days.  C: I will inform the building and they will send someone to check on you every hour to see if you need help.  P: Thank you. That will be very annoying to wait, but I am grateful that I have the opportunity to ask for help.  C: Of course. I will also call your son to inform him and maybe he can help you as well. P: He is in Florida right now, if not he would already be here and we wouldn't have this conversation.	
Moving around using equipment D465	2	C: Good evening. I am Darla. What is your name? P: Good day Darla, I am Mino. C: How was your day? P: Not so good. I need my walker way more than the last week. C: How come? P: I feel a lot weaker, I can do like 2 steps without it, but for the rest I really need it. 	C: What exactly is feeling weak? P: My legs, especially my right leg. C: Did something happen yesterday? Did you trip on your right leg? P: Nothing happened, just the usual change of wheather which is bothering my old body, you know? C: Ah, I understand. So you need the walker for moving everywhere? P: Almost everywhere yes, the only thing I can do without it is moving around in the bathroom, because it is so tiny and also in the shower I can just sit down.  C: I understand. 	C: How are you feeling about your situation right now? Do you depend on help? P: I love my situation. Of course I need a lot of help, but I am quite old and I accepted this fact. C: Lovely, so you are feeling secure and in good hands here? P: Yes, everyone is very kind. I am used to the help by now and I love that during days like that I can ask for more help and during other days I can be a bit more independant, but someone is always near if I need something. C: That is very nice to hear.	
Moving around using equipment D465	3	C: Good morning, how are you? P: I am good. Just a bit old and rusty. C: How old are you? P: 88 years old. C: You look way younger.  P: You are such a charmeur. Thank you. C: How is your walking going? Do you still use your rollator? P: It goes alright. In my appartement I am independant. But outside I need it.	C: Can you describe in more detail wh you need the rollator outside. P: In my appartement everything is flat and I know my way around, so I am good. But outside the ground is so different everywhere and I trip really fast. So I use it for my balance. C: That is very smart. Do you use it mostly for the security of it or also for the support of your body weight. P: I think mostly because I feel more stable and secure with it. I am good with my body weight. C: Would you say it is also for your head? P: Yes. Honnestly it really helps my mental state and that is why I use it outside. If I would walk without, it would be possible, but then I feel more insecure. And I am 88, so I don't wanna risk it.  C: I understand.  	C: You live in an elderly home. How does that make you feel. P: I quite like it. My best friend lives here as well. And a lot of the people here also use a rollator, so I don't feel alone. C: How does using a rollator makes you feel? P: I really hated it in the beginning. I am used to walk a lot. I used to go on quite challenging hikes and it is embarrassing to not be able to do that anymore. But everybody grows old. It is normal. C: So you just needed some time to adapt to the change? P: Exactly.

I need my walker way less than before. A bit more strengtheing and I will be able to walk without it completly. C: That sounds amazing. What did you change in your routine? P: I just included the exercises of the physio way more and now I feel so much more stable on my feet. Only my head needs to get around the fact that I can go without it. 	C: Can you tell me at which part you are still struggeling? P: Of course. When I am going to visit my daughter I will take it with me. I have to use the tram and it is way easier to get on the tram with the walker. C: You said your head is a bit the problem maker. Why is that? P: I could go without the walker for sure. But the trust in my legs is not completly there yet. So just for my own security I take it with me, although I barely use it. C: So we will work a bit more on your leg strength to fully gain the trust back. P: Sounds good. C: And then you will be also able to take the tram without your walker. P. Absolutly. That is the goal.	C: How did the adaption of your daily life go? Do you have support at home? P: It went quite ok. I have the support of my wife. She really helped me in the beginning where I could barely do anything alone. C: How do you feel, now that you gained almost all your independancy back? P: I feel so lucky. I can finally help my wife cook and clean again. I can finally support her again. It was draining our relationship a lot. C: I can see what you mean. So you are happy with the situation. P: Absolutly. It gets better everyday and I take it day by day.

The walker is not necessary anymore.	C: I love to see that your nerves recovered after you had that stroke a year ago. P: Yes. I couldn't even stand without the walker.  C: I remember. You really put the work in. Last time you said you still need it for the elevator and to walk on grass. How is that going? P: Amazing. I left the walker at home the last couple days and just walked around. Because of all the feeling I gained back, I am my old self again. I don't feel unstable without the walker. I don't need to hold on to it. It is completly useless to me know. C: That is such a great progres. Keep up with the good work and continue your exercises. Then you really will be your old self.  P: Yes, I promise I will. Being independant never felt so good!	C: How are you feeling about going back to work, now that your body has recovered? P: I am looking forward to it.
