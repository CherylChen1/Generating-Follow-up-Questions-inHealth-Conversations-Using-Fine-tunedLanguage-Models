Hand and arm use D445	4	C: Hi, how are you doing today? P: I'm doing pretty well. I walked my dog to the park this morning, and we played for a bit. C: That sounds nice! What's your dog's name? P: His name is Timo. C: Oh, Timo—cute name! What did you two play? P: We palyed frisbee fetch. It was fun. C: That’s good! Sounds like your arms are feeling much better now. P: Yes, they are. I am really able to throw the frisbee now	C: That’s good to hear. So, did you feel any discomfort when throwing the frisbee? P: Just a little. After a few throws, my shoulder felt a bit sore, but nowhere near as bad as before. C: That’s a good sign! How about your grip? Did you feel like you had a solid hold on the frisbee? P: Yeah, my grip felt a lot better. I used to struggle with holding onto things for too long, but today I barely noticed it. C: That’s progress! What about other activities, like carrying groceries or opening jars? Are those getting any easier too? P: Yeah, I’d say so. Lifting heavy bags is still a bit challenging, but I don’t feel as much strain in my arms as before. And opening jars—I still have to put in some effort, but it’s not as frustrating now.  	C: How does it feel seeing some progress? P: Honestly, it feels like a relief. It’s been tough not being able to do things like I used to, but now I’m starting to feel like I’m getting back on track. C: That's good to hear. Do you ever get discouraged, though, when things don’t go as smoothly? P: Yeah, sometimes. Some days are better than others, and it can be frustrating when I feel like I’m taking a step back.	
Hand and arm use D445	1	C: Good morning, patient name, how's everything? P: Hi, Hi. Not the best day I guess. Things are getting worse. C: Sorry about that. Could you tell me more? P: There're so many things I can't do now. Like it was a bit difficult for me to write properly. C: Why was it difficult? P: My right fingers don't listen to me.	C: i assume right is your dominant side? P: Yes. It was fine to pick up my phone, but as I tried to write, my fingers trembles. Now the handwritings are unreadable. C: I see. Are you able to carry, for example, groceries? P: Not too heavy. I avoid using my left arm because I had a shoulder replacement sugery years ago, but I'm still worried about carrying heavy stuff. You know, my arms can be ripped off again,  C: I understand you concern, you had a surgery for that already. P : Exactly, And after the surgery, my sholder became very stiff. I can't raise my arm over sholder anymore. It's also weaker than the other side.	C: Does this situation affect you emotionally? P: It's frustrating for sure, but it's not the end of the world. I can still move around. C: Good to know. Do you live by yourself or with your family? P: I live with my partner. We help each other out at this stage. She can still cook for us. She's my support.  C: I'm sure she is. Do you have kids? P: We have a daughter and two sons. My daughter lives nearby. We have dinner together every week.	
Hand and arm use D445	2	C: Hello, xxx, how are you feeling today? P: Just another day. Not good, not bad. C: Well. Have you been experiencing any difficulties recently? P: After the wrist surgery, nothing was too easy. It's painful to push through the rehab. C: I understand. I'm sure things will get easier soon enough. P: Let's hope so.	C: Are you able to use you injured side now? P: I don't use it to do anything, but I started some light weight trainings as advised. It was stiff after casting, and sometimes painful. C: How much would you rate your pain level from 0 to 10, during exercise and rest? P: At rest, I don't feel anything most of the time, during exercise, especially mobilization, it can be 4-5. Is that normal? C: It's 4 weeks after surgery. I'd say it's pretty normal. Has it gotten any better? P: That's for sure. Pain level decreased compared to post-surgery day. Now it's the rehab program triggering the pain. I can deal with it though. I think it's necessary. I'm just whining here.	C: You feelings are absolutely valid. And you're rigtht, that this process is not too pleasant, but you'll see the good result. Does your wrist cause any emotional changes? P: More or less. It's my dominant hand you know. I don't know if I can go back to the previous stage after rehab. C: I understand your worries. As long as you keep rehab programs, and check with you PT regularly. I'm pretty positive you'll be on the right track. P: Hmmm, we'll see. C: Is there anyone living with you, who can help you a bit? P: No, I'm all alone. I have my left hand to help.
