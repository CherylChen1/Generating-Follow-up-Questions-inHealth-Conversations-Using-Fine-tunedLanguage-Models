I have to get it fixed ASAP! C: I'm sure it can be fixed. What's wrong with it? P: It got stuck halfway constantly. I was almost thrown out because of the sudden stop!!	C: I'm very sorry about that. Were you injured? P: thank god no. If I got hurt, I'll meet you in the court. C: So sorry. Let's solve the problem before that. How long have you been using the wheelchair? P: You'd better do. Why does it matter how long I have been using it? You'll fix it no matter what. C: No worries, sir. We can find a solution in any case. I need to collect necessary information, so that we can help you more efficiently. P: Alright. I used it for two years. It's been working fine, but recenly I started to hear wierd noise and today got stuck. And since the incident, I stopped using it for my own safety. 	C: Understood. It's marked down. I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, how would you cope with the situation lately? P: I can stay at home. It's safe for me to stay home. C: How would this make you feel? Staying home for a few days? P: It's fine for three days, but no longer than that. C: I see. Max 3 days at home. P: Yes. Or it's gonna be boring for me.

Let me see if you are smarter than before. C: I shall try. You came to visit a neurologist 6 months ago, and diagnosed with Parkinson's. I'm sorry about that. P: I noticed some trembling in my hands half a year ago. And I became more clumsy. So I thought, maybe it's time. Parkinson is in my family history. C: You are the expert. How has it been for you after the visit? P: You know I love skating. Every Friday night I joined the stakting gathering in Utrecht. I could always make a show for everyone. But not anymore. 	C: I can imagine how tough it must be for you. P: Yes. I used to go to work by skating. Now I can't skate without someone walking by my side. I can still skate, but my legs are out of control sometimes. C: It's safer to have someone by your side. How long has it been? P: A year ago. It was during skating when I noticed something went wrong. After that, everything went down quicly. I felt unconfident to make skilful moves at first, and then regular skating became hard to control too. Imagine, within one year. C: I feel for you. Could you describe your symptoms? P: Now I have all those classic symptoms, tremors, bradykinesia. I haven't been shuffling though, but I guess that won't be far away. 	C: Does these new changes haev any emotional impact on you? P: I can't say no. This is big change to my life, but I was well-prepared. It's in my genes. My father and grandfather all suffered from a quickly-developed Parkinson's. C: It's good that you're prepared. And you know a lot about it already. P: That's right. I've taking precautions years ago. C: Do you think you can get support from others when necessary? P: Yes, I'm lucky on that. I have a very healthy wife. She's been supporting me ever since. I'd be depressed without her.

With walker, wheelchair? Or do you mean by bus, or bike? P: With my rollator.	C: Sorry that you had trouble with you rollator. Could tell me your concern? P: I can't walk outside for long distance anymore, I got tired easily even when just walking at home. C: Were you able to walk at home with your rollator? P: I still can, but on one hand, I had to be very cautious like walking on the ice. And I tend to rely more on my arms. I don't know if it's a good time for me to use a wheelchair, but I also feel reluctant to do so, cause once I use wheelchair, I might never be able to use a rollator. C: I understand, it's hard to make the decision. Is it difficult for you to keep balance with rollator. P: I don't know if balance is the main issue. Maybe it's my legs that are getting weaker. 	C: I completely understand your situation. How are you feeling with that issue? P: I'm worried. I live alone, and I intend to keep my life as it is. I don't want to move to the elder home. I don't like being amongst people. C: I agree. Your preference should be considered. Do you get enough support from others when you need it? P: I don't have children. My partner passed away 2 years sgo. I don't like being around people. I prefer not needing any support from other strangers. C: It could be challanging to offer you proper care, and it's important to keep your independence and privacy. Do you think a PT session to assess your living situation and visits of social worker would be of help? P: you may schedule a PT session, but other than that is not necessary.

P: I don't know what's going on, but I tend to fall recently. C: Oh no, how did you fall? P: I mean I almost fall when I was walking with my walker.	C: How many often does it happen? P: I can recall a few times last month. I buckled for no reasons and my arms were supporting me on the walker, so that I didn't really fall. C: How long has it been? P: not very long. Less than 2 months I think. It's scary when it happens, I don't know what's wrong. C: I understand your concern. Have you noticed anything that might trigger those moments? P: Maybe uneven surface.. or maybe I was only trying to walk faster, but I'm not sure, but I think I need some more stable assistance now.	C: I see you. How are you feeling with needing more assistentance? P: I think it's a natural process. I had a serious emotional hit when I had to use the walker, but now, I feel nothing. C: Do you think it's acceptable for you? P: It doensn't matter whether I want to accept or not. It just happens. C: I'm sorry about that. Maybe you can schedule a PT session and see what's best for you. P: I don't think that's gonna help.
