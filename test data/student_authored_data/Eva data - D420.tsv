Transferring oneself D420 	1	C: Hi, how are we doing today? P: Not so well. C: Would you tell me more about it? P: I feel weak. I couldn't get out of my bed this morning. I had to wait for the nursing assistant to help me. C: I'm sorry about that. Could you get up with help? P: Yes, but I don't like it. I don't want to rely on others. I need to be able to do it myself.	C: I do feel for you. I'm sure it'll get better. Could you describe what you have to do to get up from bed? P: I need to move myself towards the edge of the bed first, and then I can push the button to lift up my upper body into a sitting position and then I can transfer to my wheelchair. C: I see that. At which step do you find difficult? P: I struggle at every step if I'm on my own. It's impossible for me to get up by myself. C: I see. Do you have a helper at home? P: Yes, I have one since last week, but it's very expensive. I wonder if there's anything I can do.  	C: There are things we can still improve, I'm sure. How do you feel about your current status? P: It's terrible. Living a life relying on others. I wish I could end this. C: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have family around you? P: No, I'm all alone. My partner passed away last month. I shall go with him soon enough. C: I'm truly sorry for your loss. It must be tough for you. May I arrange some visits for you even if it's not a family visit? P: I'm not sure if it's gonna help, but OK.

Did someone go to the hospital? C: Yes, Mr. J, you were in the hospital 3 months ago. Now you're home. I'm calling to check how you're doing. P: I was in the hospital? I don't recall that. What do you wanna know?	C: Have you met any difficulties recently, with transfering, with eating, with showering? P: I don't know. I can eat, I can take shower. No problem. What do you mean by transfer? C: Good to know that eaing and showering are not an issue. Transfering means, for example, from wheelchair to sofa, from wheelchair to toilet, are you able to do that? P: Oh, I'm very strong. Of course I can do everything. C: I'm glad to hear you're feeling strong. Have you noticed there are some moments that you can't do it by yourself? P: I don't know why. Sometimes I peed in my pants, and I'm not sure what happened.	C: I see. How do you like your living status now? P: Oh, everything's great. Only wierd things are happening sometimes. Lat night, I was patroling at school, and then somehow I was home.  C: How do you feel about that? P: Just wierd. But that's life wierd things happen. C: You're right. P: What? Who are you?
Transferring oneself D420 	4	C: Good afternoon, Mrs. Liu, how are you? P: Oh, nice to have you calling. I'm good, and you? C: I'm well. Thanks for asking. How's life? P: As usual. I live with my big family. We have a helper at home. Nothing to complain about. C: That's good to know. Let me know if you meet any difficulties. P: Just one thing maybe. I stuggle a bit with moving from chair to chair.	C: Can you tell me more about it? P: Yes. At home, we have big table, where we gather to eat dinner. And around the table, there are high wooden stools, without backrest. Everyday before dinner, I sit on the first stool and then I move to the one closer to the wall, so that my husband can sit on the one outside. But I always find it inconvenient. C: Did you need help when moving? P: It depends on how the stools are placed. Sometimes it's easy for me to scoop in, sometimes no. And I can't move the stools while bending. C: Why not? P: It's difficult for me to bend, and the stools are heavy, I don't think I can move them anyway.	C: Thank you. Now I get the full picture. How do these difficulties in life make you feel? P: I'm used to it. I had an even worse situation only one year ago.  C: It's nice to know that you take it optimistically. P: Yes, if you have experienced worse. I was on tubes last year, and now I can eat by myself. You'd have been satisfied with what you have after what happened. C: It's inspiring to see how far you've come. How do do you feel about that? P: Everybody says it's miracle. And I agree. I'm happy with what I have.
