Hand and arm use D445	1	C: Good morning Theo, how is everything going? P: Hey, in all honnesty today is a terrible day. Basically everything is getting worse.  C: Sorry to hear that. Could you tell me what is bothering you? P: There are so many things I am not able to do at all. I can't even grab a pen at the moment. C: Why is that so difficult? P: My whole hand feels numb and I can't control when I close my fingers into a fist. 	C: Is it your right or left hand? I assume it is your dominant side? P: Yes. My dominant hand is my left. It was fine picking up a cup to trink, but as soon as the object was tinier, I could not grab it anymore. My fingers start trembeling and I can't controle the movements anymore. So frustrating.  C: I understand. Are you able to carry bigger objects, like your phone? P: Phone yes, but not things that are heavier. Then I need to use my right hand or I need to ask for help. I feel like when I use my left hand more the symptoms will get worse and I don't wanna go back to where I was not able to use it at all.  C: I understand why you would think that. But actually the more you will use the hand, the more the brain can build up the connection to the muscles again.  P: OMG, I had no idea.	C: Is that situation affecting your mental state? P: Sooo much, You have no idea. I hate it.  C: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you live alone or together with your family? P: I live with my husband and our 3year old child. He is my support system. I can't live without him. C: How does that make you feel? P: Amazing because I have my loved ones around me, but horrible because I am so dependant on him and having a toddler is already challenging enough so I think it can be a bit too much for him sometimes. C: Understandable.	
Hand and arm use D445	2	C: Hey Maria, how are you feeling today? P: Just like every other day. Not too good, not too bad. C: Alright. Have you been experiencing any difficulties recently? P: I mean, directly after the elbow surgery, nothing worked and was quite painful. But it is getting a bit better.  C: I completly understand and I think it will get a lot better with all the rehabilitation exercises I will show you. P: Let's hope so.	C: Are you able to use your injured side for eating? P: Honnestly I barely use it, only together with the physio for some light exercises like pressing a ball to build up my strength. It is still very stiff. C: Is the stiffness affecting your daily life?  P: Yes, I can't get dressed on my own and need help washing. But I am able to eat with the fork by myself which I am so greatful for.  C: Is there any pain during eating in your elbow? P: I don't think so becaue it is more the mobility of my wrist than my elbow that I am using.  C: That makes sense, so you are painfree? P: I mean not totally and it is still a long way to go but for 2 weeks after the surgery it is normal pain I would say. The exercises trigger the pain sometimes, but I can deal with it.	C: How does being dependant on other people make you feel? P: I feel a bit shit because I was so independant before and I don't have a partner so I rely on my mum and friends which feels weird. C: You feelings are absolutely valid. And being dependant never feels the best, but you will see the progres and that you will need less help any day.  P: I don't know. We'll see. C: As long as you stick to your exercises and you do something for improvement and not be lazy, I can guarantee you, you will see progres, fast.  P: That is helping. Thank you. My biggest ennemy really is my head. But it will be alright. 	
Hand and arm use D445	3	P: Good morning. C: Good morning, how are you doing? P: Quite okay. I went for the first walk with my dog alone after the surgery. C: That sounds amazing. How was it. P: He behaved really good, so it was nice. But I am not able to hold him with my hand from surgery when he is pulling towards another dog. C: Makes sense, but then the dogs also develop massive strength. P: Haha yes that is true. Sometimes I also can't hold him then with my healthy hand.	C: How is the rest going? Are you able to use your injured arm in most scenarios? P: Pretty much yes. Except for tying my shoes and closing my bras. That is not working yet because it is too precised movements for my fingers. C: What exactly is making it hard for you? P: I think it is the holding on to the material while swirling it around. It always slippes away. C: So we will work on the tiny movements with your fingers. P: That sounds very good, because the rest I can do on my own.	C: How do you manage your daily life at home? P: It really annoys me that I still need to ask my husband for help for the little things. It has been such a long time. I wanna be independant again. C: What exactly is bothering you? P: That I have to ask for help. Everytime it is like overcoming a fear. I hate it. I grew independantly and it is the first time I feel so helpless. C: I understand. But I can promise you that we will work on the tiny motions and you will be sooner independant again than you can say "cheese". 	
Hand and arm use D445	4	C: Good evening, what is your name? P: Hello, I am Mila. How are you? C: I am great, thanks for asking. I am Peter, your nurse for today. What is still problematic for you? I heard your surgery isnow 6 weeks ago. P: Yes, that is correct. Basically I can use my hand for almost everything. But I play the flute professionally and I am not able to play for the instant. C: Such a cool job. How often do you practice? P: Bevor the surgery I practiced everyday, but now because of the stiffness, more like 3 times a week.	C: So I think the goal for the next 2 weeks is to work on your stiffness. How exactly do you feel it. P: I feel it the most in my index and ring finger. The most mobile finger is my thumb. C: Which movements are stiff? More the flexion or extension of the fingers? P: MY indexfinger has the most problems with the extension and my ringfinger with the flexion. C: Great that you can describe it that clear. So we will work on extension and flexion in every finger to increase the mobility. P: Nice. And then you think I can practice the flute more often? C: We will take it slow at the beginning so you don't have any pain appearing, but then yes.  P: Cool.	C: How secure are you in your job position? P: Quite secure. But I worry a lot that my ability to play the flute will not be the same as before and then I will have a problem. C: What worries you the most? P: I think that I won't be able to play the main part in the opera anymore. That was my specialty back in the day. C: We will work extra special on the mobility and with a lot of practice you will get your mobility back. P: Thank you so much. That relieves my stress a bit.	
Hand and arm use D445	5	C: Good afternoon Hans. How are you doing? P: I am doing quite good actually. And you? C: Also good. Thanks for asking. How is the healing progres going? P: I think I am healed. Honnestly that might be our last session together. C: You think? You have full mobility and strength back? P: Yes, it is amazing. I can do everything I needed help before.	C: So your elbow and wrist fracture is not affecting you at all anymore. P: Not a bit. Since my cast got removed and we did so many exercises, everything improved. I can now also hold my sticks for the drums and do my tricks again. Finally! C: That sounds amazing. So not even holding the newspaper page is making you problems anymore? We practiced that last week. P: Nope. I can finally read in peace without getting annoyed in the morning. I am loving it. C: So happy to hear that. So what do you wanna practice today? P: I think just some exercises I can also do at home to keep all the strength intakt. 	C: How do you feel about having your last physio session and getting back to your old routine? P: Very excited but also scared. C: Why scared?  P: Maybe when I am not doing it with a professional anymore, my arm will get stiff again and I have to get another surgery. C: I can assure you that as long as you keep it moving and do the exercises at home you will alright. It is not going to get broken just like that.  P: I am glad to hear that and I also will include the exercises in my daily life. Just to be sure.
