C: Hey Mr. Garcia, how are you doing today? P: Same as usual. C: And how are you usually feeling? P: Not great. C: Tell me why that is P: I can’t even move around my own house. C: How come?  P: I’m having issues with using my wheelchair.	C: That’s distressing news. What struggles have you been having with your wheelchair. P: I tried to get around the house yesterday, but I couldn’t move forward. C: What’s keeping you from moving forward? P: My arms are too weak, the chair barely budged. C: That sounds discouraging. Is there any pain when you try and move forwards or is it purely a strength issue? P: No pain, just not enough arm strength to propel myself forwards. C: Understood. So, how have you been moving around your house. P: I have a lovely neighbor who comes and moves me when I ring his phone. C: That sounds like a great neighbor. P: He’s the best.	C: How does your condition make you feel?  P: I feel as if I have no autonomy at all. It was already horrible that I ended up in this wheelchair and now I can’t even use it. I can’t do anything C: I’m so sorry you’re feeling that way. You haven’t lost your autonomy you’re just in a tough spot. I’m here to help you regain as much independence as possible. Let’s work together on building your arm strength so you can start propelling that chair on your own. P: Okay
Moving around using equipment D465	2	C: Hi, my name is Alexia, I’m your physiotherapist today. P: Hi Emma, I’m Alexandra. Nice to meet you. C: Nice to meet you too, Alexandra. How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking? P: I’m 67. C: Great, thanks for sharing. Have you been having a good day so far? P: I’m a bit tired C: I hear you. Let’s take it at your pace today. P: OK.	C: I saw that you had some issues coming into the clinic room. Have been having issues moving around with your walking stick. P: It's been a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. I can’t really manage on my own. C: What’s holding you back from using it independently? P: I can stay balanced when I’m still, but when start to take a few steps I feel really unsteady. C: So, if I’m understanding it correctly, your balance is the limiting factor. P: Definitely balance. I feel like I’ll tip sideways, especially if there’s any uneven pavement. That’s why I always need my husband to walk beside me and hold my other arm.	C: Are you always afraid of falling? P: Pretty much. I’ve tried going alone a few steps outside the house, but I get too nervous. If my husband is not there to hold on to, I just don’t feel safe. C: I get how you’re feeling. How do you feel about your inability to independently walk down the street with your walking stick? P: Its obviously quite annoying having to rely on another person to do such a simple task, although, secretly I don’t mind. It gives me a good excuse to hold onto my husband. C: I appreciate your honesty. It makes perfect sense to find comfort in having that support even while wanting more independence. P: I’m glad you understand.
Moving around using equipment D465	3	C: Hi, I’m Jordan, your physiotherapist today. P: Hello Jordan, I’m Maria. Nice to meet you. C: Nice to meet you too, Maria. Do you mind telling me your age? P: I’m 72. C: Thank you. How has your day been so far? P: I’m a little out of breath. C: I noticed you struggled a bit when you walked in with your walker, does it have anything to do with that?  P: It does, I’ve been having issues moving around with my walker.	C: Please, tell me what you are struggling with. P: I manage getting around, but I get wobbly on corners and when I change direction. C: So, your walker provides sufficient support, but turning and balancing remain challenging? P: Exactly. I can get from the living room to the kitchen, but I have to stop and steady myself several times. C: Understood. Would you say that stopping to regain balance is your main difficulty? P: Yes, I feel like I’m nearly falling every time I pivot.	C: How do you feel about your condition? P: I’m scared to death. I had a nightmare where I fell whilst using my walker. That can’t be sign that it’ll actually happen right? C: I’m sure it was just a nightmare. With the right approach we can improve your ability to more around with your walker. P: That’s all I want. I want to move more freely. I have had enough of all this worriment C: That is understandable. Let’s get started. P: Agreed.
Moving around using equipment D465	4	C: Hey there, welcome! I’m Hazel, your physiotherapist. P: Hi Hazel, I’m Diego. Good to meet you. C: Likewise, Diego. How is life. P: I can’t complain, what about you? C: Neither can I. Before we dive in, how old are you if you don’t mind sharing? P: I’m 68. C: Alright so based on your file, I can see that you had hip replacement surgery, Is that correct? P: Yes, it is.	C: I also noticed you came in on your crutches. Did they teach you how to use them in the hospital?  P: Yeah, they did. C: How has using them been since your hip surgery. I see in your file the surgery was 1 month ago. P: I manage well. I can move around the house and even up and down the porch steps without help. C: That’s excellent progress. Does the hip stiffness ever slow you down? P: No not really. It’s mainly my palms that start hurting once I’ve been moving around with my crutches for too long. C: How quickly does that pain start to arise and what do you do to make it go away. P: It comes after about 20 minutes. I don’t need to do much for it to go away. Just a short rest C: So, you’re essentially fully independent with crutches, with just minor pain in the palms after 20 minutes P: Exactly.  C: With regard to the hip, I asked about stiffness but do you have any pain. P: A little yes. It’s a sort of dull aching pain that typically comes if I push too far. Nothing I can’t handle.	C: Despite how well you’re managing to move around with your crutches, I can imagine that you’re looking forward to the day you can go without. P: Yeah, it’s been way too long. I’m grateful for how well I’m doing but I can’t wait until I’m properly on my feet again. C: Refresh my memory, when did the surgeon say you could go without? P: 17 days from now. I can survive another 2 and a half weeks. C: That I am sure of.

Did you feel confident on the steeper runs? P: Absolutely I never hesitated, even on the black-diamond slopes.	C: That’s excellent.

Now, my confidence is at an all-time high. C: I’m happy for you. Shall we begin our session and build on that confidence? P: Let’s get started!
