Transferring oneself D420 	1	  C: Hey Cynthia, how have you been doing? P: Honestly, not so well. C: I’m sorry to hear that, can you explain why that is the case? P: I’ve been struggling transferring from my wheelchair to my bed. C: How annoying. You said “recently”, can you tell me how many days you have been struggling with this issue. P: The exact amount of days I’m unsure of but it has been getting progressively harder.  	C: OK. I’ll try my best to help you. So, can you elaborate a little further by telling me what exactly is limiting your ability to transfer from wheelchair to bed. P: I no longer have the strength for it. C: The lack of strength, does that have to do with your legs? P: Yes, it does. C: Has it become impossible to transfer or do you eventually get there? P: It’s become impossible. I can’t do it anymore. C: Where in the process of transferring does it go wrong? Are you able to stand up from your chair? P: I can get up a little bit but before I can fully straighten my legs, I end up falling back into my chair.	C: That sounds very frustrating, has that taken a large toll on you? P: Yes, it has. I live alone so I’ve had to ask my son to help me out the last few days. Luckily, he lives around the corner but I still feel like I am burdening him. C: I understand. Do you have any other feelings regarding your current condition? P: No, I only feel bad for my son.   
Transferring oneself D420 	2	C: Good afternoon ma’am, my name is John. What’s your name? P: Good afternoon John, my name is Sarah. C: Since this is the first time we meet, is it okay if I ask a few personal questions? P: Yes of course! C: OK. So, how old are and could you describe your living environment. P: I am 71 years old and for the past 40 years I have been living with my husband. C: What did you do for work? P: I used to be a data analyst. C: Alright, so can you now tell me why you are here today? P: I have been struggling getting out of bed.	C: I’m sorry to hear that. Currently, how are you managing to get out of bed? P: I get my husband to help me.  C: What part of getting out of bed do you need help with? P: I have trouble getting myself seated upright. Once I’m seated by the edge of the bed I can get out. It’s getting to that position that is hard. C: And so, your husband helps by pulling you up? P: That is correct. C: Does your husband help you a lot or do you only need a little assistance. P: He doesn’t help too much but I can’t do it without him.	C: Has this been difficult for you and your husband? P: Yeah, it’s been quite tough. I’m afraid that if this were to continue, it will lead to him injuring his back. C: Does your husband have issues with his back? P: Yes, a lot. He has had many surgeries. Currently he’s doing well but I hope to keep it that way. C: I understand, we’re going to do our best to keep you and your husband healthy. P: Thank you, I appreciate that a lot. 
Transferring oneself D420 	3	C: Hey, my name is Elisabeth, I will be your physiotherapist for today. P: Hi Elisabeth, my name Susanne, nice to meet you. C: Nice to meet you too. How old are you Elisabeth? P: I am 63 years old. C: Alright Susanne, what can I help you with? P: I have had 2 total knee replacements and feel as if I never fully gained my strength back. It’s been difficult getting up from a seated position. 	C: That’s unfortunate. So, it’s difficult but not impossible? P: Yeah, I’m able to stand up but it just costs me a lot of energy.  C: If I were to ask you to repeatedly stand up and sit back down, how many times do you reckon you could do it? P: I think I could do about 4 back to back.  C: And each and everyone one of those feels physically demanding? P: Yeah, they do. C: Purely from out your muscles or do you also get out of breath? P: A bit of both but primarily the muscles.	C: How do you feel about your situation? P: I’m afraid of getting old and I feel as if this may be this first signs that I am at that point in my life. C: Do you feel like your age? P: No not really, I feel much older than I actually am. I feel as if my body should be much more capable at 63 years old. C: I feel for you. We’re going to work on your ability to transfer and that should leave you feeling more capable. P: Thank you very much.
Transferring oneself D420 	4	C: Hey Michelle how are you today?  P: Hi Anastasia, I’m doing pretty well, our physio sessions together have really helped me transfer better. C: That’s great to hear! Last few sessions we worked on floor transfers in case you fall onto the floor. Have you practiced those at home? P: Yes, I have. Although, I am having some difficulties with them. C: That’s fine, it’s something new so we will continue to work on that today. P: Okay, perfect.	C: Alright so let’s start off with the difficulties you mentioned having. P: Yeah, so what’s been happening is when I transfer from my wheelchair down to the ground, everything goes well but at the end I let myself fall a bit too much.  C: I see, do you have the idea that your strength is insufficient? P: No, I don’t think so, I just think my technique needs some perfecting. C: OK. In a second, we will get to the movements but first I would like to ask some additional questions. P: That’s fine by me	C: Its now been quite a while since you have had your spinal injury, how has it been adapting to your new way of living. P: At first it was hard, I felt useless, everything I used to be able to do become an impossible task. But luckily now that is no longer the case. Those tasks no longer feel impossible and day by day things are going better. C: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s keep up the good work and get to practicing those transfers. P: Lets do it!
Transferring oneself D420 	5	C: Good morning sir, my name is James, how are you doing today? P: Good morning, my name is Joseph. I’m doing good, and you? C: I’m also doing good. So, I see based on your referral that you had a small stroke a few months ago is that correct? P: Yes, that is true. C: OK. I see the reason the doctor referred you was in order to improve your physical condition. We will focus on strength and cardiovascular endurance training. But first, in the file I see you had some issues transferring, is that still the case? P: No, it’s actually improved a lot.	C: You don’t find yourself in any situations where you feel unsure of your ability to transfer? P: Nope C: You no longer require any assistance? P: No not anymore C: Perfect, the transfers itself, are they physically demanding or would you have to do them several times back to back in order to experience any exertion P: No, not physically demanding at all, I think after 10 I might feel something. C: That’s great to hear. Is it okay if I ask you some additional questions before we start our training session? P: That’s okay.	C: After a stroke, I imagine a lot changes in one’s life. How have you experienced this? P: I definitely started taking my health more seriously. I’m just so grateful that it was a small stroke. I would hate to be in a wheelchair. C: Have you changed your lifestyle at all after the stroke? P: I immediately started eating healthier since my high cholesterol was the most likely culprit of my stroke. C: Anything else P: Yes, I also started going on walks more often. I felt as if I was inside too much and should appreciate mother nature more often.
