Using transportation D470	1	C: Hey, It’s been a while. How have you been feeling lately? P: I’ve been feeling well, thanks! I actually just got back from a short trip. C: That sounds great! Where did you go? P: My wife and I went to Groningen. C: Nice! How was the trip? P: It was really fun. It’s been a long time since I last traveled, so it felt great to get away for a bit. C: That’s wonderful! Did you drive there yourselves? P: No, we took the train.       	C: What is the most difficult part for you? P: The unstability. I can't walk properly so I am scared of walking in a moving bus when they start to early. C: Anything else that is bothering you? P: Yes, I am way too unstable to go up and down the stairs on the bus. If I would do it, I would also be way too slow. I am just bothering all the passengers. C: I am sure they would understand. Why do you feel unstable? P: I am just so weak on my legs. It feels like they can't support my body at all. C: I see.	C:How do you go from one place to another then? P: Gladly my wife can drive me everywhere? C: Are you two normally using the car that often? P: Not at all, the gas prices are horrible at the moment. We have a bit of money problems, so it is really bothering me. C: I understand. What are you worrying the most about? P: That it will never get better with my weakness because I am so old and then we will struggel a lot with our money. C: We will work on your muscle strength and then this problem will not bother you anymore.	
Using transportation D470	2	C: Good morning, how are you feeling today? P: Like everyday, kinda alright. C: Why not totally alright? P: Because a friend of mine died and I want to go to the funeral, but nobody can drive me and I can't go by train. C: I am so sorry to hear that. Why can't you use the train? P: Because the gap is too big for me. C: You can ask for mobility support and then the staff will provide a ramp for you. P: I am also not able to do it on my own.	C: What is the biggest problem for you when you use the train? P: I am dependind on someone to bring my walker with me, because I am so unstable everywhere. The gap is too big for me and my walker and I can't carry it up the stairs.  C: So you need your walker for everything and the train is too much of a hustle? P: Yes, exactly.  C: If you would be in the train, would you be able to move around freely? P: If you mean by freely with my walker, then yes. But at the moment it is vacation time and way too many people are in the train for me to walk with my walker. C: I see your point.	C: Is it hard for you to depend on other people? P: I despise it. Especially in the public, I depend on people I don't know. I just have to trust random people. They could rob me. C: I think most people are kind and willing to help. Robbing is an extreme example. P: That is true. But still a possibility. C: Do you have people around you that take care of you? P: Not really, because my wife recently passed away, so I am really on my mind. C: I am so sorry. I will ask around the hospital, to make sure you have somebody around who looks after you. P: Thanks.	
Using transportation D470	3	C: It has been a bit of time since I have seen you. How are you doing? P: Not too bad, I would say. C: You are smiling and looking so relaxed. Did you go on vacation? P: Oh yes, I did. It was amazing. C: Did you go by train? P: No actually it was a short trip to Mallorca by plane. C: And you had no problems with using the plane? P: Some, but nothing my family and I couldn't figure out together.	C: What kind of difficulties did you deal with? P: Going on and off the plane was fine. My wife hold my arm and gave me stability and my children carried my luggage. C: That sounds good. P: But the sitting down in this tiny space and sitting for 3 hours straight was quite difficult. C: And why is that? P: Because of the nerve impingement, my legs constantly fall asleep when I don't change my sitting position every 15min. And in the plane I didn't have the luxus to move around a lot. C: I see. So what did you do to improve your numbness in the legs? P: I powered through and accepted my faith.	C: Is it annoying for you that you still have these problems now? P: A bit, but I am so glad that I could go on vacation, that this part is way too little to make me upset. C: That is very good. So you have energy to continue your treatment? P: Oh yes, I am so motivated, I will be without numbness in no time. C: Sounds amazing. And then the next vacation can come. P. Already booked. With the help of my family I can conquer everything!	
Using transportation D470	4	C: Long time no see. How is it going? P: True, I haven't seen you in a month. I am doing great. How about you? C: Also good. What have you been up to? P: I did some trips with my husbands with the train. Celebrating that I am almost at my old self again. C: Sounds amazing! Where did you go? P: Through France from the border of Germany until the border of spain. C: Lovely. 	C: How did the train rides go? P: Actually really well. I can do almost everything on my own now. C: Except for? P: Except for going off to the train. There I still need to hold on to my husband and he carries the luggage for me. C: Why is that? P: Going down the stairs and then over the big gap is way more intimidating than going over it and then up the steps. I can't rationally explain it, but there I feel less secure and rather hold on to my love than fall. C: That makes a lot of sense actually. 	C: How is your new independancy affecting your life? P: So amazingly. I feel like myself again. I don't need my hsuband for everything and I can finally visit my daughter on my own. I just ask people to lift my luggage of the train for me and give me a hand. C: That sounds like a great solution. How is your relationship affected by that? P: Positively. It feels like we never fight at the moment and we are much more in harmony. C: Love to hear that.

P: Yesterday I used the bus and then afterwards the train completely on my own and nothing bad happened. C: That sounds amazing. Where did you go? P: To a movie theater. 	C: The feeling of being weak and unstable going on the bus is not there anymore? P: I mean I am still a bit more worried of falling than I was before, but it is no comparison to the last weeks. I felt wuite strong and comfortable on the bus, the train I felt even better, because it does not have so many turns as the bus does. C: I get what you mean. How did you deal with your luggage? P: I had only a little bagpack with me and that was completly fine. Next time I will use a carry one just for practice. Then I know for sure if I am caoable of dealing with it on my own.
