Transferring oneself D420 	1	C: Hi, how are we doing today? P: Not so well. C: Would you tell me more about it? P: I feel weak. I couldn't get out of my bed this morning. I had to wait for my partner to help me. C: I'm sorry about that. Could you get up with help? P: Yes, but I don't like it. I don't want to rely on others. I need to be able to go at least where I want to go.	C: I do feel for you. I'm sure it'll get better. Do you need any assistance when you walk? P: I have both rollator and a wheelchair. I was able to walk at home with the rollator, even if just a few steps, but recently, I felt weaker. I tried to get on the wheel chair, but it's not convenient to move around at home. I usually use wheelchair to go outside, but they are not for home. It's not convenient to move around at home. C: I see that. Are you able to get on the wheelchair by yourself? P: I can't. I feel like my legs and arms are too weak to get me up. Especially if where I sit or lie is low, I don't have strength to stand up on my own. C: I see. Is it difficult for you to transfer to the toilet? P: My toilet was adapted. That was fine. I had better support there.  	C: That's good to know. You mentioned you live with your partner, has he/ she been helpful? P: I can't live without him now. Thank god he's still strong, but he has bad eyesight. We are supporting each other. C: How are you coping with your current situation? P: I wish I can grow stronger, a few months ago, I was still able to get up, although struggled a bit. Now I'm sad that I need help for theat.

How are you doing today?  P: I am not doing so good. I am scared of going outside of my bed, because my legs feel so weak. C: I am sorry to hear that. Do you feel comfortable to leave your bed with a bit of help? P: Yes, with a bit of help it is alright. But I really wanna build up my abilities to leave my bed on my own. C: Understandable. For this morning I will help you and then we will build up your strength together. P: Sounds great. Thank you.	C: With which part of getting out of bed do you have the most problems? P: Honnestly with putting myself in a seated position. C: Why do you think that is the hardest? P: I don't trust my abdominal strength, that is why I have the feeling that I will fall over as soon as I am seated. C: And do you feel like you will fall over to the front, back or to one side? P: To the front most parts and a bit to the side.  C: Do you have the same feeling when you are standing or is it just like that when you are seated? P: While standing it is even worse because my legs feel so weak.	C: Are you dependant an your significant other for help? P: Yes, so much. And it is so frustrating. I was never a weak person and now I even need help to get out of bed. C: How are you coping with this frustration? P: Honnestly I cry a lot and need a lot of affection and good words from my partner. Without her I could not do it. She is an angle. C: It is good to hear that you have so much support. And I am sure we will get you stronger in the coming weaks so you have it easier leaving your bed. P: That would be amazing.	
Transferring oneself D420 	3	C: Good evening sir. How was your day? P: Hello. My day was quite nice except for one thing. C: Can I ask you what went wrong? P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles. C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound? P: Sounds great. Thank you so much.	C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet? P: I try to slowly lean forward and get into kinda a squatting position and then the pain would shoot in my stomach and I would let myself fall on the toilet because I am not able to hold the position. C: I see your problem. You don't use your arms at all which means your upper body can only rely on your abdominal muscles. Let me demonstrate how you can protect these. P: Yes of course. Thank you so much. C: So if you are standing in front of the toilet you have two handles next to it. So you get into a bit of a squat position but really not a lot. Then you put both of your hands on the handles and put your weight on the arms and not on stomach. After that you can slowly guide yourself down into a sitting position. Wanna try? P: Yes sure. 	C: Do you have any help at home? P: No, I live still alone because my wife just passed away and before I could move in an appartement where there is help, I had to go to the hospital. C: Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. But that means as soon as your out of the hospital you will have help? Or you will still live alone for a bit? P: Still alone for a bit. But maybe my son will have the time to help me out. C: Please let me know until our next meeting how your situation at home will look like so I can prepare your abilities. P: Yes of course, thank you so much for considering that.
