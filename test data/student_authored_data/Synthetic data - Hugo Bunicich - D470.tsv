Using transportation D470	1	C: Hello, I’m Emma, your physiotherapist, what’s your name? P: I’m Liam. C: Nice to meet you, Liam. How has your day been? P: It could be better. C: Why is that? What brings you in today? P: I have trouble using transportation.	C: I am sorry to hear that. Could you please elaborate. P: I have knee pain that has been so severe, I can only travel door-to-door via taxi. C: That sounds worrisome. Could you tell me a bit more about your pain? Where is it and what exacerbates it. P: So, it’s my left knee, and every time I put weight on it, there is a severe stabbing pain. It feels as if its deep inside the knee. C: What would you rate that pain on a scale from 0-10, 10 being the worst pain imaginable. P: It’s around an 8.	C: I can imagine you’re feeling quite frustrated by this pain and the inability to travel independently. P: Yeah it really is, I just want to know what’s wrong with my leg and how I can fix it. I would do anything for that to happen.  C: I completely understand. We’ll get to the bottom of your knee pain. P: You’re a life saver
Using transportation D470	2	C: Good afternoon Mrs. Adams, my name is Greg. P: Oh please, call me Marguerite. C: Marguerite, got it. Before we get started, I notice that your GP isn’t registered in our system, do you happen to know his name? P: Yes of course, its Dr. Jacobs   C: Alright, perfect, I added it to your file. What brings you in today? P: Unfortunately, ever since October, I haven’t been able to travel to the city like I used to.	C: Before October, how did you travel into the city? P: I would take the tram close to my house. C: What makes it that you can no longer do that? P: I can, but no longer alone. I am dependent on my partner. He has to help me board and find a seat. C: I see, what part of the journey do you struggle with most? P: Climbing the three steps onto the tram is painful, and I’m unsteady once I’m inside.	C: That sounds frustrating. How does relying on someone else every day make you feel? P: It makes me feel a bit guilty but at the same time a little embarrassed. C: I can understand that but do note that it is nothing to be embarrassed about. Tell me, are you at all afraid you are going to fall? P: Very. A friend of mine recently fell and broke her hip. At the moment she can’t do anything at all anymore. God forbid that happens to me. C: Thank you for sharing 
Using transportation D470	3	C: Hi, I’m Jenna, your physiotherapist, what’s your name? P: I’m Alex. C: Nice to meet you, Alex. How has your day been so far? P: It’s been alright. C: What brings you in today? P: I’ve been having trouble catching the city bus to work. 	C: Why is that? P: The route the bus takes is extremely bumpy and every bump, or even a sudden stop, sends a jolting pain through my lower back.  C: Is it focal or does the pain also radiate to any other locations in the body? P: Its purely in the lower back C: Could you rate this pain from 0, no pain at all, to 10, the worst pain ever? P: I would give it a 4 or a 5. The pain is manageable with pain killers, and albeit its annoying, halfway I have to transfer buses, which gives my back a break. C: What kind of painkillers do you take and do you take them every morning in anticipation of the bumpy bus ride? P: I take 2 paracetamols every morning before I go to work.	C: Do you ever feel frustrated or discouraged traveling to work. P: Honestly yes but I need the money so I never take any days off. C: Has your back pain affected your confidence in getting around independently? P: No, I wouldn’t say so. I get to where I need to be but and I’m confident in my ability to do so. The journey is simply a nuisance and frustrating. C: I know what you mean. I’ll take a look at your back and afterwards we’ll come up with a treatment plan to solve this issue. P: Alright.
Using transportation D470	4	C: Hello Jane, it’s good to see you again, how are you today? P: Hi, I’m doing alright, thanks. C: How has your week been since our last session? P: It’s been busy but I’ve been managing.  C: Have you been facing any troubles taking the bus to work? P: A bit, but I can tell that things are going in the positive direction.  	C: What troubles did you run into? P: The mornings are always busy. Usually I stand for the first 10 minutes on the bus, but after the train station stop, I can sit for the remaining 15. Monday that wasn’t the case. C: How did your body respond to that? P: Surprisingly I managed until the end of the ride however I felt It a lot in my body. C: Where in your body did you feel it? P: My legs and lower back were sore for about 3-4 days.	C: How do you feel about this experience.  P: The soreness was irritating but I was happy to see that I am capable of enduring the entire ride. I just wish I didn’t get so sore afterwards. C: I’m glad you see this as a positive experience. I believe with some muscular endurance training we can smoothen your bus journeys within no time. P: That sounds amazing! 
Using transportation D470	5	C: Good morning Joshua, how are you doing today? P: Hi Michael, I’m doing good, how about yourself? C: I am also good, thanks for asking! Did you have a good holiday? P: Yeah it was great! The family and I flew to Malta and took a ferry to one of the nearby islands. C: That sounds wonderful. Did you have much trouble with the plane or ferry? P: It all went swimmingly!	C: How did your new ACL hold up during the trip. P: Works like a charm, had no pain whatsoever. C: That’s great to hear! You didn’t get any swelling in the leg when you were in the plane? P: A little bit but no more than any other person. I was by the emergency doors so I had the leg room to stretch and move around a bit. C: Some extra leg room is always nice. Sounds like you had a very nice trip. P: It was great	C: I can imagine this trip boosted your spirits.  P: 100 percent. I was having some serious doubts, I didn’t believe that the ligament would survive the trip. I was close to canceling. I guess I’m much more capable than I thought. C: That you are. Shall we get started with our session? There’re still a few extra degrees of flexion we can get out of that knee. P: Let’s do it!
