Transferring oneself D420 	1	C: Hi, how are we doing today? P: Not so well. C: Would you tell me more about it? P: I feel weak. I couldn't get out of my bed this morning. I had to wait for my partner to help me. C: I'm sorry about that. Could you get up with help? P: Yes, but I don't like it. I don't want to rely on others. I need to be able to go at least where I want to go.	C: I do feel for you. I'm sure it'll get better. Do you need any assistance when you walk? P: I have a wheelchair. I was able to walk at home a bit with the help of my son, but recently I feel a lot weaker and I need my wheelchair for basically everything. But it is not convenient at home at all. For getting in and out of the wheelchair I depend on my son 100%. C: I see that. Are you able to do anything with the wheelchair by yourself? P: I can't. I feel like my legs and arms are too weak to get me up. Especially if where I sit or lie is low, I don't have strength to stand up on my own. C: I see. So we will need to work on your strength, so you will be less dependant on your son.  P: That sounds like a good plan. I am sick of feeling so weak.  	C: That's good to know. You mentioned you live with your partner, has she been helpful? P: I can't live without her now. Thank god he's still strong, but he has bad eyesight. We are supporting each other. C: How are you coping with your current situation? P: I wish I can grow stronger, a few months ago, I was still able to get up, although struggled a bit. Now I'm sad that I need help for that.	
Transferring oneself D420 	2	C: Good morning, I am Annabelle and I will take care of you this morning. What is your name?  P: Good morning, my name is Heinz.  C: Nice to meet you Heinz. How are you doing today?  P: I am not doing so good. I am scared of going outside of my bed, because my legs feel so weak. C: I am sorry to hear that. Do you feel comfortable to leave your bed with a bit of help? P: Yes, with a bit of help it is alright. But I really wanna build up my abilities to leave my bed on my own. C: Understandable. For this morning I will help you and then we will build up your strength together. P: Sounds great. Thank you.	C: With which part of getting out of bed do you have the most problems? P: Honnestly with putting myself in a seated position. C: Why do you think that is the hardest? P: I don't trust my abdominal strength, that is why I have the feeling that I will fall over as soon as I am seated. C: And do you feel like you will fall over to the front, back or to one side? P: To the front most parts and a bit to the side.  C: Do you have the same feeling when you are standing or is it just like that when you are seated? P: While standing it is even worse because my legs feel so weak.	C: Are you dependant an your significant other for help? P: Yes, so much. And it is so frustrating. I was never a weak person and now I even need help to get out of bed. C: How are you coping with this frustration? P: Honnestly I cry a lot and need a lot of affection and good words from my partner. Without her I could not do it. She is an angle. C: It is good to hear that you have so much support. And I am sure we will get you stronger in the coming weaks so you have it easier leaving your bed. P: That would be amazing.	
Transferring oneself D420 	3	C: Good evening sir. How was your day? P: Hello. My day was quite nice except for one thing. C: Can I ask you what went wrong? P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles. C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound? P: Sounds great. Thank you so much.	C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet? P: I try to slowly lean forward with the help of my rollator and get into kinda a squatting position and then I would feel a bit of pain and with that I am not comfortable so I ask the nurse to help me sit down. C: I see your problem. Do you not trust the steadiness of your rollator or is the pain that strong that you get scared? P: Maybe pain is the wrong word. It is more a new uncomfortable feeling and yes the rollator has wheels so I don't trust that he holds my weight while sitting down. C: Okay, I see. I will show you how much you can trust the rollator, because trust me, the brakes are amazing and then you don't need the help of the nurse anymore and you are only dependant on the rollator.   P: That would be so great, because then I don't need to wait so long to go to the toilet. 	C: Do you have any help at home? P: No, I live still alone because my wife just passed away and before I could move in an appartement where there is help, I had to go to the hospital. C: Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. But that means as soon as your out of the hospital you will have help? Or you will still live alone for a bit? P: Still alone for a bit. But maybe my son will have the time to help me out. C: Please let me know until our next meeting how your situation at home will look like so I can prepare your abilities. P: Yes of course, thank you so much for considering that.	
Transferring oneself D420 	4	C: Hello. How are you doing today? P: I am good. Just some minor inconviences, but for the most part I am alright. How are you? C: I am also good. Thanks for asking. Can you tell me which inconveniences are bothering you? P: Of course. I have a bit of trouble getting from standing back on my bed into sitting. And I don't wanna ask the nurses for help, because it is so much better than the days before, but I need a tiny bit more help.  C: I understand what you mean. We can practice it together so you are more comfortable with that. How does that sound? P: Very nice. Like that I don't have to bother anyone. C: I am sure you are not bothering people if you ask for help. The nurses and I gladly help you.	C: Good morning, I am Rihanon and I will help you today.  P: Good morning, that sounds very good. It is not a bad day but I struggel a bit with getting from sitting into laying.  C: That is lovely to hear. Would you mind telling me what makes it difficult for you? P: Of course not. I am quite uncomfortable with bending my upper body, so going to on side is a bit harsh on my body and I don't know how I can lay down in any other way. C: Is it more the bending to the front, side ot back that is harsh on your body? P: I think the bending to the side is the most problematic. As soon as I do it, I tense up and then I rather ask the nurse for help, then trying it on my own again. I am quite sure I could do it on my own. Just my head is a bit in the way still. C: Great that you can describe it that detailed. So we will work on that today and we will try to get the trust in your body back. Sounds good? P: Sounds amazing.  	C: I want to ask you about the situation at home. Do you feel comfortable living alone again? P: Almost yes. I only struggel sometimes with laying in bed in the evening if I have done a lot of garden work for example during the day. C: How do you cope? Are you calling somebody? P: Yes, I am very lucky that my daughter lives across the street and these days she comes over to dinner anyways so she helps me in this situation. C: How do you feel about that? P: A bit annoyed because I want to be able to do everything alone again, but really lucky because I have such an amazing daugther. C: Understandable. I am sure you will soon be independant!

Everything is alright. C: I am very glad to hear that. So you don't have problems anymore with extending your hip? P: Nope, all the pain is gone. C: And you did not get any different medication?

But now you can play with your grandkids and not miss out on any activity. P: Thank you for the reminder. That is true and it is great.
