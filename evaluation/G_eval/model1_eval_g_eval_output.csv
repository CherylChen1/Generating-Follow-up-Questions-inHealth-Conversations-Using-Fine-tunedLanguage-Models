For this morning I will help you and then we will build up your strength together. P: Sounds great. Thank you. C: With which part of getting out of bed do you have the most problems? P: Honnestly with putting myself in a seated position. C: Why do you think that is the hardest? P: I don't trust my abdominal strength, that is why I have the feeling that I will fall over as soon as I am seated. C: And do you feel like you will fall over to the front, back or to one side? P: To the front most parts and a bit to the side. C: Do you have the same feeling when you are standing or is it just like that when you are seated? P: While standing it is even worse because my legs feel so weak. C: Are you dependant an your significant other for help? P: Yes, so much. And it is so frustrating. I was never a weak person and now I even need help to get out of bed. C: How are you coping with this frustration? P: Honnestly I cry a lot and need a lot of affection and good words from my partner. Without her I could not do it. She is an angle.","It sounds like your partner plays a very important role in your recovery.

I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles.","I see. It sounds like transferring from standing to sitting on the toilet is particularly challenging for you.

Thank you so much. C: So if you are standing in front of the toilet you have two handles next to it. So you get into a bit of a squat position but really not a lot. Then you put both of your hands on the handles and put your weight on the arms and not on stomach. After that you can slowly guide yourself down into a sitting position. Wanna try? P: Yes sure.

So, how have you been moving around your house. P: I have a lovely neighbor who comes and moves me when I ring his phone. C: That sounds like a great neighbor. P: He’s the best. C: How does your condition make you feel? P: I feel as if I have no autonomy at all. It was already horrible that I ended up in this wheelchair and now I can’t even use it.

Have you ever talked to anyone about how you’re feeling?,5,5,"The follow-up question is highly relevant as it directly addresses the patient's emotional state and feelings of loss of control.

C: So, if I’m understanding it correctly, your balance is the limiting factor. P: Definitely balance. I feel like I’ll tip sideways, especially if there’s any uneven pavement. That’s why I always need my husband to walk beside me and hold my other arm.","That makes sense. Do you feel more confident using your walking stick on smooth, even surfaces, or is it difficult even in familiar environments?",5,5,"The question is a natural continuation of the conversation, addressing the patient's specific concern about balance and uneven surfaces.

C: I also noticed you came in on your crutches. Did they teach you how to use them in the hospital? P: Yeah, they did. C: How has using them been since your hip surgery. I see in your file the surgery was 1 month ago. P: I manage well. I can move around the house and even up and down the porch steps without help. C: That’s excellent progress. Does the hip stiffness ever slow you down? P: No not really. It’s mainly my palms that start hurting once I’ve been moving around with my crutches for too long. C: How quickly does that pain start to arise and what do you do to make it go away. P: It comes after about 20 minutes. I don’t need to do much for it to go away. Just a short rest C: So, you’re essentially fully independent with crutches, with just minor pain in the palms after 20 minutes P: Exactly. C: With regard to the hip, I asked about stiffness but do you have any pain. P: A little yes. It’s a sort of dull aching pain that typically comes if I push too far. Nothing I can’t handle. C: Despite how well you’re managing to move around with your crutches, I can imagine that you’re looking forward to the day you can go without. P: Yeah, it’s been way too long. I’m grateful for how well I’m doing but I can’t wait until I’m properly on my feet again. C: Refresh my memory, when did the surgeon say you could go without? P: 17 days from now.
