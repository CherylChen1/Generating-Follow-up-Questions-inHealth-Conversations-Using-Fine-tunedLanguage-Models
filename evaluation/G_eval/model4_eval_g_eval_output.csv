P: I try to slowly lean forward with the help of my rollator and get into kinda a squatting position and then I would feel a bit of pain and with that I am not comfortable so I ask the nurse to help me sit down. C: I see your problem. Do you not trust the steadiness of your rollator or is the pain that strong that you get scared? P: Maybe pain is the wrong word. It is more a new uncomfortable feeling and yes the rollator has wheels so I don't trust that he holds my weight while sitting down. C: Okay, I see. I will show you how much you can trust the rollator, because trust me, the brakes are amazing and then you don't need the help of the nurse anymore and you are only dependant on the rollator. P: That would be so great, because then I don't need to wait so long to go to the toilet.","Yes, exactly. Now let me try to explain this process again with a bit more detail and then we can practice it together.",5,5,"The question continues the conversation in a coherent and contextually appropriate way, building on the previous discussion about using the rollator to sit down on the toilet.

12,6,"C: Good evening sir. How was your day? P: Hello. My day was quite nice except for one thing. C: Can I ask you what went wrong? P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles. C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound? P: Sounds great. Thank you so much. C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet? P: I try to slowly lean forward and get into kinda a squatting position and then the pain would shoot in my stomach and I would let myself fall on the toilet because I am not able to hold the position. C: I see your problem. You don't use your arms at all which means your upper body can only rely on your abdominal muscles. Let me demonstrate how you can protect these. P: Yes of course. Thank you so much. C: So if you are standing in front of the toilet you have two handles next to it. So you get into a bit of a squat position but really not a lot. Then you put both of your hands on the handles and put your weight on the arms and not on stomach. After that you can slowly guide yourself down into a sitting position. Wanna try? P: Yes sure. C: Do you have any help at home?
