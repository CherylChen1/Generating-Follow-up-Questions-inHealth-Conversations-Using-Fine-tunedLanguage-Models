We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound? P: Sounds great. Thank you so much. C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet? P: I try to slowly lean forward and get into kinda a squatting position and then the pain would shoot in my stomach and I would let myself fall on the toilet because I am not able to hold the position. C: I see your problem. You don't use your arms at all which means your upper body can only rely on your abdominal muscles. Let me demonstrate how you can protect these. P: Yes of course. Thank you so much. C: So if you are standing in front of the toilet you have two handles next to it. So you get into a bit of a squat position but really not a lot. Then you put both of your hands on the handles and put your weight on the arms and not on stomach. After that you can slowly guide yourself down into a sitting position. Wanna try? P: Yes sure. C: Do you have any help at home? P: No, I live still alone because my wife just passed away and before I could move in an appartement where there is help, I had to go to the hospital.","Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. But that means as soon as your out of the hospital you will have help? Or you will still live alone for a bit?",5,4,"The follow-up question is highly relevant as it continues the conversation about the patient's living situation and his plans for the future. The doctor shows empathy towards the patient's loss, which makes the question even more appropriate. However, the faithfulness score is not perfect because the patient didn't explicitly mention a timeline for moving into an apartment with help."
12,7,"C: Good evening sir. How was your day? P: Hello. My day was quite nice except for one thing. C: Can I ask you what went wrong? P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles. C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound?

It also shows that the doctor is concerned about the patient's well-being and wants to prepare for their next meeting. The only reason I didn't give faithfulness a perfect score is that the question assumes that there will be changes in the patient's situation, which might not necessarily be the case."
