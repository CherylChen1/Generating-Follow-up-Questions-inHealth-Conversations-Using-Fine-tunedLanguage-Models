So, I see based on your referral that you had a small stroke a few months ago is that correct? Patient: P: Yes, that is true. Doctor: C: OK. I see the reason the doctor referred you was in order to improve your physical condition. We will focus on strength and cardiovascular endurance training. But first, in the file I see you had some issues transferring, is that still the case? Patient: P: No, it’s actually improved a lot. Doctor: C: You don’t find yourself in any situations where you feel unsure of your ability to transfer? Patient: P: Nope Doctor: C: You no longer require any assistance? Patient: P: No not anymore Doctor: C: Perfect, the transfers itself, are they physically demanding or would you have to do them several times back to back in order to experience any exertion Patient: P: No, not physically demanding at all, I think after 10 I might feel something. Doctor: C: That’s great to hear. Is it okay if I ask you some additional questions before we start our training session? Patient: P: That’s okay. Doctor: C: After a stroke, I imagine a lot changes in one’s life. How have you experienced this? Patient: P: I definitely started taking my health more seriously. I’m just so grateful that it was a small stroke. I would hate to be in a wheelchair. Doctor: C: Have you changed your lifestyle at all after the stroke? Patient: P: I immediately started eating healthier since my high cholesterol was the most likely culprit of my stroke.",

But I almost broke a glass when I couldn't stop while picking it up to drink something ebcause the chair just rolled backwards. Doctor: C: Glad that nothing worse happened. How long have you been using the wheelchair? Patient: P: Not that long. For like 3 months. It should not be broken. I still have guarantee on it. Doctor: C: Very good, so as soon as they fix it you will have your normal routine back. Should I help you with anything until they are here? Patient: P: That would be nice. Maybe you can hold my wheelchair as long as I put makeup on so I don't accidently stab my eye with the mascara. Doctor: C: Of course. I will be your breaks for the next minutes, haha. Doctor: C: How are you feeling about the broken brakes? Patient: P: It is really fucked. I am just getting used to the fact that I have to use a wheelchair as a help. And now it is broken. I just got the hang of it. And now I need help again. It is soooo annoying. Doctor: C: I can understand that. Do you need extra help? Patient: P: That would be great. Because the mechanics didn't have the right breaks for my model so they ordered it online. They will arrive in 3 days. Doctor: C: I will inform the building and they will send someone to check on you every hour to see if you need help. Patient: P: Thank you. That will be very annoying to wait, but I am grateful that I have the opportunity to ask for help.",

Let’s take it at your pace today. Patient: P: OK. Doctor: C: I saw that you had some issues coming into the clinic room. Have been having issues moving around with your walking stick. Patient: P: It's been a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. I can’t really manage on my own. Doctor: C: What’s holding you back from using it independently? Patient: P: I can stay balanced when I’m still, but when start to take a few steps I feel really unsteady. Doctor: C: So, if I’m understanding it correctly, your balance is the limiting factor. Patient: P: Definitely balance. I feel like I’ll tip sideways, especially if there’s any uneven pavement. That’s why I always need my husband to walk beside me and hold my other arm. Doctor: C: Are you always afraid of falling? Patient: P: Pretty much. I’ve tried going alone a few steps outside the house, but I get too nervous. If my husband is not there to hold on to, I just don’t feel safe. Doctor: C: I get how you’re feeling. How do you feel about your inability to independently walk down the street with your walking stick?
