P: My name is Sheila, nice to meet you.

Model4: C: Of course, Sheila. What’s going on?							
Model5: C: Please, tell me, what’s going on?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I can’t even get my front door open.							
Model1: C: I see. Can you tell me more about how you manage getting in and out of your home?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model2: C: That sounds really frustrating. Can you tell me more about how it feels when you try to open the door? Is there a specific part of your body that’s causing difficulty?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? What makes it hard for you to open the door?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what’s happening with the door?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model5: C: Can you tell me more about that?	Valid	1	1	2			
P: I try to turn the doorknob, but my hand just won’t grip or twist.							
Model1: C: Have you noticed any specific difficulty with your hand strength or coordination when trying to open doors?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: I see. Have you tried using any tools or devices to help with the doorknob, like a key or a handle extender?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That sounds really frustrating. Is it always hard for you to open doors, or is there a particular situation that makes it worse?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That must be really frustrating for you.	Valid	1	2	2			
Model5: C: Is there also pain or any tingling sensations in the hand or wrist?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: A bit of both yes.							
Model1: C: Have you noticed if the pain or tingling gets worse when you try to grip or twist the doorknob?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: Have you noticed any weakness in your hand or difficulty with other tasks that require grip strength, like holding a cup or using utensils?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a bit more about how this is affecting your daily life?	Valid	1	2	1			
Model4: C: Can you describe what the pain feels like—sharp, dull, throbbing?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Have you had this for a long time?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Yes for 3 months							
Model1: C: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to perform other tasks with your hands, like opening jars or holding a cup?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: And has it gotten worse over time, or has it stayed the same?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: And is it getting worse?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: And is it getting worse?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: 3 months? That’s a long time. How have you been entering and leaving your house?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I live in a good neighborhood so I just leave the door open a crack. But unfortunately, the last time I did that someone walked inside and stole some stuff.							
Model1: C: That must be really stressful. Have you considered using a key holder or a tool that might make it easier to open the door without twisting the doorknob?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s really frustrating, and I can see how it’s been a big concern for you. Have you tried any ways to make the doorknob easier to turn—like using gloves or a tool?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Oh dear! That must have been really stressful.							
Model4: C: Oh no, that’s terrible. Did you report it to the police?	Valid	1	5	5			
Model5: C: That’s awful, I’m sorry to hear that.	Valid	1	3	5			
P: Thank you.							
Model1: C: I can understand how frustrating and unsafe that must feel. Have you considered using any kind of assistive device or tool to help with opening the door, even temporarily?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: So, you’ve been managing by leaving the door ajar, but that’s not safe. Have you tried using any tools or devices to help with the doorknob? Like a key or a tool that can assist with turning it?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model3: C: Is there anyone who could help you with your doors? Like a family member or friend?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: So, how do you feel about not being able to get the front door open?	Valid	1	3	5			
Model5: C: Why is it that you chose to handle your wrist pain in this manner? Were you too busy to come see a physio?	Valid	5	4	5			
P: No, I just didn’t think that my condition was serious enough to have looked at. People suffer from so much worse.							
Model1: C: I understand that it’s easy to downplay our own symptoms, but it sounds like this has been affecting your safety and peace of mind. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to do other daily tasks, like cooking or dressing?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model2: C: I understand that it’s easy to downplay our own struggles, especially when others seem to have more severe issues. But hearing that you’ve been struggling with your wrist for three months and haven’t been able to open your door—this is definitely something worth addressing. Have you noticed any changes in how your hand or wrist feels over the past few weeks?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That’s understandable, but we can still work together to find solutions.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: I see. That makes sense, but it sounds like your situation is impacting more than just the door.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Not being able to turn your doorknob to enter your house is a definite red flag.	Valid	2	1	1			
P: Ah, I see, so I should have come earlier?							
Model1: C: Yes, it’s never too early to seek help. I’m glad we’re here now. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to grip or twist since the theft?	Valid	2	2	1			
Model2: C: Yes, it’s important to address even small limitations early on, especially when they affect your safety and independence. Let me ask—have you noticed any other tasks becoming difficult lately?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Yes, you could have. But it’s good that we’re here now and can work together to get your wrist back in shape.	Valid	1	1	3			
Model4: C: Yes, we can work on that together. But for now, let’s focus more on the doorknob issue and how it affects you daily life.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Yes definitely. Now, let me take a look at your hand and wrist.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Yes, please do.							
							
C: Hello, my name is Ben, what’s your name?							
P: My name is Sam							
Model1: C: Nice to meet you, Sam. Can you tell me a bit about how you usually move around at home? For example, do you use any equipment like a walker or cane when transferring from one place to another?	Invalid			5			
Model2: C: Nice to meet you, Sam. How can I help you today?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Nice to meet you, Sam. How old are you?	Valid	1	3	5			
Model4: C: Nice to meet you, Sam. How old are you?	Valid	1	3	5			
Model5: C: How old are you Sam?	Valid	1	3	5			
P: 52							
Model1: C: Do you feel confident moving around your home independently, or do you sometimes need help with tasks like getting in and out of a chair?	Invalid			5			
Model2: C: Great to meet you, Sam. How can I help you today?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Nice to meet you, Sam. Can I ask how your day has been so far?	Valid	1	1	5			
Model4: C: Good morning Sam. How can I help you today?	Valid	1	1	5			
Model5: C: I saw you drive into the clinic’s parking lot, you’ve got quite a sizable vehicle.	Invalid						
P: Well, funnily enough, it’s my car I’ve been having issues with. I’ve been having issues opening and closing my car door.							
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about the difficulty with opening and closing your car door — do you find it challenging to operate the handle, or does the door not open properly when you try?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s interesting. Can you tell me more about how the car door is acting—like, does it stick or not open at all?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? What’s been difficult for you when opening or closing the door?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: P: Yeah, it’s a bit of an issue. I need to use my hands a lot more than before.							
Model5: C: That’s annoying. Has this always been an issue or could you first do so with ease.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Despite its size, it used to be rather easy. It’s only a bit heavier than any other car door.							
Model1: C: Have you noticed any changes in your arm strength or shoulder mobility recently that might be contributing to this difficulty?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed any specific difficulties when trying to open or close the door—like resistance, pain, or limited range of motion?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: I see. Have you noticed any specific situations where this becomes more challenging for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Okay, so there’s been some change in your ability to open and close doors recently. Is it the same with both hands or is one side more challenging than others?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: What changed? Do you feel as if you have lost the strength?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: In general, yes, but I notice it most when trying to open or close my car door. With both movements I can manage the first part, but then I have to twist my shoulder in a way that makes it hard to generate enough strength to continue.							
Model1: C: It sounds like the twisting motion is particularly challenging for you. Do you ever experience any pain or discomfort in your shoulder or arm when performing this movement?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds really frustrating. Do you find that this difficulty affects how often or how far you’re able to go on errands?	Valid	1	3	3			
Model3: C: That sounds like a significant challenge. Have you tried any strategies to make it easier? For example, using tools or asking for help?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That’s interesting. Can you describe the sensation of twisting your shoulder? Is it more like a strain or tightness?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model5: C: Are you capable to reposition your body to be able to produce the strength from another position?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I have tried but 9 out of 10 times there are other parked cars that are in the way.							
Model1: C: I see. So, when you're trying to open or close your car door, the issue seems to be more about the positioning and space rather than just the strength itself. Have you considered using a door opener device or asking for assistance from others in such situations?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: I see. So even when you try to reposition, there’s often limited space? Have you considered using a door opener tool or some kind of assistive device for the car door?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: It must be frustrating not being able to get in and out of your car as easily. How do you feel about this situation?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: So you feel like your car door is a bit of an obstacle for you. What do you think might help?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: So, how did you open and close your door today, I didn’t see when I glanced outside.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: My son is with me, he is in the waiting room. I try and drag him along everywhere I go so that he can give the extra little push or pull I need.							
Model1: C: That’s really thoughtful of you to involve your son. Do you ever feel frustrated or concerned about relying on him for this task?	Valid	1	2	2			
Model2: C: That’s really thoughtful of you to involve your son. How often do you need his help with opening or closing the door?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That must be a bit challenging for you both, having to rely on each other in this way.	Valid	1	2	2			
Model4: C: That’s very thoughtful of you to involve your son. Do you feel like this is causing any issues for him or affecting his daily routine?	Valid	3	2	5			
Model5: C: I see. That sounds frustrating. How does it feel emotionally when something as simple as opening a car door becomes difficult?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: It’s humiliating, people stare when I struggle to close my door. I never thought something so small would feel like such a hurdle.							
Model1: C: It sounds like this challenge is not just physical, but also affecting your confidence and social comfort. Have you considered using a door opener or other assistive device to help with this task?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model2: C: That must be really tough to deal with. It sounds like opening and closing the car door isn’t just physically challenging—it’s also affecting your confidence and how you feel about yourself in public. Have you ever considered using a power-assisted door opener or some kind of adaptive device for your vehicle?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That must be really tough for you, Sam. Do you have any support or coping strategies that help with these feelings?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model4: C: I can imagine it feels that way. Do you feel like there are any specific situations or people involved in this difficulty? For example, is it just opening and closing the door itself, or also getting out of the car?	Valid	1	3	3			
Model5: C: I’m sorry that you have to go through that. Do you find yourself avoiding situations because of it?	Valid	1	3	3			
P: Sometimes. For example, with groceries, when I see that the parking lot is full, I decide to just go back home and go another day to avoid the embarrassment of people seeing me struggle open and close my car door.							
Model1: C: That must be really difficult. Have you considered using a door opener or other assistive device to make this task easier and more independent?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s really tough to deal with. It sounds like this situation is affecting not just your physical ability, but also your confidence and independence. Have you considered using any kind of aid or modification for the car door—like a power-assisted door opener or a lever system?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That must be really tough. How do you think we could help make this easier for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That makes sense. It sounds like this is not just about the physical challenge but also about how it affects your daily life and interactions with others.	Valid	1	3	3			
Model5: C: Thank you for sharing that. We’ll make it our goal to find ways to make these tasks feel manageable again.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I’d really like that. I don’t want to keep feeling this limited.							
							
C: Hi Helen, long time no see, how are the children?							
P: Hey, they’re doing good, I’m glad you were able to fit me in so late notice.							
Model1: C: Thank you for letting me know, Helen. I appreciate your flexibility. I understand you’ve had some recent challenges with mobility—could you share a bit more about what’s been difficult for you lately?	Valid	2	1	5			
Model2: C: No worries at all, Helen. I’m glad to see you. How have you been feeling lately? Any changes in your mobility or daily activities?	Valid	2	1	5			
Model3: C: No worries at all! I just got back from my lunch break. So, how have you been feeling lately? Any changes in your mobility or daily activities that we should discuss?	Valid	2	1	5			
Model4: C: No worries, I have a few questions about your mobility that we can go through.	Valid	2	1	5			
Model5: C: No worries, one of my clients ended up canceling, freeing up a slot. What can I do for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: 2 months ago, I had surgery on my shoulder and ever since then I have been having some issues.							
Model1: C: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the specific issues you're experiencing with your shoulder and how they affect your ability to move around or perform daily tasks?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model2: C: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what kind of issues you've been experiencing since the surgery?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: I see. How have you been managing with your daily activities? Any challenges that stand out to you?							
Model4: C: Sorry to hear that. What kind of issues are you experiencing?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: I’m sorry to hear that, what happened to your shoulder?	Valid	1	2	1			
P: I tore my labrum throwing a baseball.							
Model1: C: I see, that must have been tough. Have you had any difficulty transferring yourself from a seated to standing position since the surgery?	Invalid	2	2	3			
Model2: C: That sounds challenging. How has your mobility been since the surgery—specifically, moving around or transferring yourself?	Invalid	2	3	3			
Model3: C: Ah, I see. That can be quite painful and challenging to recover from.	Valid	1	1	3			
Model4: C: Oh no, that sounds painful. How have you been managing with the pain since then?	Valid	1	1	3			
Model5: C: Ouch, that must’ve been quite painful. What issues are you running into?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: To name one, it’s been difficult brushing my teeth.							
Model1: C: I see, so you're having trouble with daily tasks like brushing your teeth due to shoulder pain—have you noticed any specific movements or positions that make it worse?	Valid	2	2	2			
Model2: C: I see. Can you describe how it feels when you try to brush your teeth—does it hurt, or is it more about difficulty moving your arm?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: I see. Can you tell me more about how that’s been affecting your daily routine?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Can you tell me more about that? What’s making it hard for you?	Valid	1	2	1			
Model5: C: What makes it that brushing your teeth is difficult.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I constantly need to take breaks. After about 30 seconds I stop and resume after another 30 seconds.							
Model1: C: I see, that sounds really frustrating. Do you find it hard to maintain consistent movement or does the discomfort come and go during brushing?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds really frustrating. Do you find that your arm feels weak or unstable when you try to hold the toothbrush?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That’s a good way to manage it, but have you noticed any other difficulties with your shoulder? Like reaching for things or carrying groceries?	Valid	2	2	1			
Model4: C: That sounds really frustrating. Are there other daily activities that you find challenging, like cooking or cleaning?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Do you require breaks due to pain?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I wouldn’t call it pain, it’s more like a deep fatigue in the shoulder.							
Model1: C: How does that fatigue affect your ability to perform daily tasks beyond brushing your teeth?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model2: C: I see. How does that fatigue affect your ability to complete the task of brushing your teeth? Do you find yourself needing to adjust your technique or use one hand more than the other?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: I see. What’s been the impact on your daily life?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you noticed any other difficulties with daily activities that might be related to your shoulder?	Valid	4	1	1			
Model5: C: During the break, what do you do with the arm? Do you just let it hang by your side?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I prop my elbow on the sink. It helps a bit, but it still takes me double the time it used to.							
Model1: C: How does this affect your daily routine or emotional well-being? Do you feel frustrated or anxious about completing tasks like brushing your teeth?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model2: C: That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any limitations in your range of motion when brushing, like difficulty reaching back or up?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model3: C: How have you been managing with daily activities? Are there any specific tasks that are challenging for you?	Valid	3	1	2			
Model4: C: I see. Have there been other activities that have become more challenging since the surgery?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: How has this impacted your life?	Valid	4	3	1			
P: It wears on me. It makes me feel older than I actually am. But I’m determined to keep doing it myself.							
Model1: C: That sounds really frustrating. Have you considered using any kind of adaptive tool or equipment to make brushing your teeth easier?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s really admirable. Have you noticed any other activities that feel similarly challenging or draining?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That’s a great attitude! Do you have anyone who can help with brushing or other tasks?	Valid	4	3	1			
Model4: C: That’s a great attitude. Do you have any support for this transition—family, friends, or perhaps someone who could help with daily tasks?	Invalid	5	5	2			
Model5: C: I feel for you. It is good that you’re still determined. If it’s alright with you can you take your shirt off so that I can look at the shoulder. I’ll be doing some tests	Valid	1	1	1			
P: No problem at all.							
							
C: Hi Mr. Reynolds, how are you.							
P: Hey, Tom, I’m doing better and better every day. I’m currently also on paternity leave. My wife and I recently had a baby boy.							
Model1: C: That’s wonderful news! I’d love to hear more about how your daily activities are going, especially with the new baby. Do you feel confident moving around safely at home while taking care of your newborn?	Invalid	3	3	5

P: Thank you! It’s been amazing, even though the lack of sleep is definitely catching up to me, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It’s also been a perfect opportunity to spend more time with my 8-year-old son.							
Model1: C: That sounds like a truly rewarding experience. I can see how being on paternity leave has given you more time to focus on family, which is so important. Have you noticed any changes in your mobility or energy levels since starting this leave?	Invalid	3	5	5			
Model2: C: That sounds like such a rewarding time. I can imagine how much joy it brings to have that extra time with your family. Have you noticed any changes in your mobility or energy levels since starting paternity leave?	Invalid	5	5	5			
Model3: C: That sounds like a great balance between work and family life. Speaking of which, how have you been managing your mobility lately? You mentioned earlier that there are some challenges with transferring from the bed to wheelchair or vice versa.	Valid	1	1	5			
Model4: C: That sounds wonderful. How have you been managing with your mobility aids—like the walker and wheelchair?	Valid	3	2	5			
Model5: C: That is nice. What have you been doing with your 8-year-old.	Valid	1	5	5			
P: We’ve been playing a lot of baseball. Yesterday we tossed a ball back and forth in the backyard.							
Model1: C: That sounds like a great way to bond and stay active. Do you find that playing baseball helps you maintain your energy levels or does it sometimes feel challenging due to any mobility limitations?	Invalid	3	5	5			
Model2: C: That sounds like a great way to bond. Did you have any difficulty throwing or catching the ball recently?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model3: C: Sounds like a fun activity. You mentioned earlier that you've been having some difficulty with your mobility lately.	Invalid	3	3	5			
Model4: C: Sounds like a fun way to spend time together. How was that experience for you—playing catch with your son? Was it easy or challenging?	Invalid	3	3	1			
Model5: C: How did you manage?	Invalid	4	3	1			
P: Just some minor hiccups.							
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about those minor hiccups—did they affect your ability to move around or use your arms comfortably during play?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: Can you tell me more about those hiccups—did they involve any difficulty with your arm movement or throwing?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Hiccups? Can you tell me more about what happened?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Minor hiccups? What do you mean by that?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: That’s great to hear. Could you elaborate on the hiccups? Were you not able to keep up with him?	Valid	3	1	1			
P: Oh, I kept up alright. But I’ll admit, after five or six throws, my shoulder started to feel a little sore.							
Model1: C: I see. So the soreness started after a few throws—did it feel like a sharp pain or more of a dull ache? And did it limit your ability to continue playing?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: I see. Did you notice any difficulty with your range of motion or strength when throwing the ball?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: I see. Have you had any issues with your arm since the birth of your son?	Invalid	5	1	1			
Model4: C: That makes sense. How about reaching for things or doing any other activities that might require arm strength?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Did the soreness stop you from continuing?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: No, nothing like that. I just took it a bit slower. We still played for a good half hour.							
Model1: C: That sounds like a positive experience. Have you noticed any lingering discomfort or limitations in your shoulder since the activity?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s great to hear. Did you notice any limitations in your arm movement or range of motion while playing? For example, did it feel harder to reach back or throw with full strength?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That’s great. It sounds like you were able to enjoy the time with your son despite feeling a little sore.	Valid	1	2	2			
Model4: C: That’s great. How about your arm—did it feel any weaker or more tired during those throws?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Sounds like you're managing well, just with some mild discomfort.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Exactly. It's not ideal, but it doesn’t really hold me back. I just need to ice it afterward.							
Model1: C: That’s good to know. Have you noticed any specific movements or activities that make the soreness worse?	Valid	3	1	1

Model3: C: and you have to deal with this on your own, which is a bit more challenging for the day.	Valid		3	5			
Model4: C: how does it feel to be alone and having this issue with your wrist?	Valid		1	5			
Model5: C: do you have any feeling or fear of this situation getting worse and affecting you more?	Valid		1	5

Model5: C: OK in which range you start to feel pain.	Valid		1	5			
P: it's like not much for instant, for example when I am trying to use key and open my door when I am twisting my wrist with a little bit of resistant and pressure then I start to feel a little bit.
