Model1: C: How has this been affecting your daily life, and do you feel comfortable relying on your husband for this assistance?	Valid	1	1	5

C: Hey, my name is Elisabeth, I will be your physiotherapist for today.						
P: Hi Elisabeth, my name Susanne, nice to meet you.						
Model1: C: Thank you for coming in, Susanne. I’d like to start by asking about your experience with transferring yourself from one place to another—like moving from a bed to a chair or getting up from the floor. Can you share how that feels for you?	Valid	4	3	2		the question is too rushed and too focused on the problem to be the first question. It might be stressful for the client.
Model2: C: Thank you, Susanne. I’m looking forward to working with you. How are you feeling today?	Valid	1	1	3		
Model3: C: It's a pleasure to meet you too, Susanne. Before we start, can I ask how old are you?	Valid	2	2	2

Model4: C: Do you have any mobility issues right now?	Valid	1	1	1		we have to tell the client the reason we ask this question
Model5: C: Alright Susanne, what can I help you with?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: I have had 2 total knee replacements and feel as if I never fully gained my strength back. It’s been difficult getting up from a seated position.						
Model1: C: I see. Can you describe how it feels when you try to get up from a seated position — do you experience any pain, instability, or difficulty with balance?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: I understand that can be really challenging. Can you tell me more about how it feels when you try to stand up from a seated position? Do you need assistance, or do you manage on your own?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: I see. That must be challenging for you.	Valid	1	2	2		
Model4: 	Invalid					
Model5: C: That’s unfortunate. So, it’s difficult but not impossible?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: Yeah, I’m able to stand up but it just costs me a lot of energy.						
Model1: C: I see. When you're trying to get up from a seated position, do you use any assistive devices or techniques to help you?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: I see. How does that affect your daily activities—like getting up from a chair or bed?	Valid	3	2	1		
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? For instance, how do you feel right after sitting down?	Valid	3	5	2		
Model4: C: How would you rate your strength—on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is very weak and 5 is strong?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: If I were to ask you to repeatedly stand up and sit back down, how many times do you reckon you could do it?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: I think I could do about 4 back to back.						
Model1: C: That’s helpful to know. Do you ever feel anxious or frustrated when trying to get up from a seated position, especially in situations where you don’t have much time or support?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That’s a good number. And when you’re doing those movements, do you feel any specific areas of your body working harder or causing more discomfort?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: Alright. What makes it harder for you when trying to get up from a seated position?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: That sounds like a fair amount. Do you find it more challenging in the morning or evening?	Valid	3	1	1		
Model5: C: And each and everyone one of those feels physically demanding?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: Yeah, they do.						
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed any particular situations or times of day when this feels even more challenging?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: How does that affect your daily activities—like getting out of a chair, going up and down stairs, or even just sitting for long periods?	Valid	2	1	1		
Model3: C: It sounds like there's a real challenge with the act of getting up from sitting, especially after your knee surgery. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to stand? Do you feel any pain or discomfort in particular areas?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: Have you ever had a situation where the act of getting up was more challenging or dangerous?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: Purely from out your muscles or do you also get out of breath?	Valid	2	2	1		
P: A bit of both but primarily the muscles.						
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed if there’s a particular time of day when this feels more challenging, like in the morning or after sitting for a while?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: And when you’re sitting, do you find it hard to stand up from a chair or more so from the floor?	Invalid	5	5	2		
Model3: C: How are you feeling about your progress so far?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: Can I ask you about your daily routine a little? For example, how often do you get up from sitting in the morning?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: How do you feel about your situation?	Valid	2	2	1		
P: I’m afraid of getting old and I feel as if this may be this first signs that I am at that point in my life.						
Model1: C: That sounds really challenging, both physically and emotionally. Do you feel that this fear of aging is affecting your confidence in doing everyday activities?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That sounds really heavy, Susanne. It must be difficult to feel like you’re losing your strength and independence. Have you noticed anything else that makes this feeling worse or more concerning?	Valid	1	2	2		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you had any support from family or friends who could help with some of these tasks?	Valid	1	1	1		the answer is not in line with client's emotion.
Model4: C: That’s understandable. But it sounds like you have a support system around you.	Valid	2	2	1		we should say why we're making this observation
Model5: C: Do you feel like your age?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: No not really, I feel much older than I actually am. I feel as if my body should be much more capable at 63 years old.						
Model1: C: That sounds really frustrating. Have you ever talked to someone about these feelings before?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That sounds really frustrating. Have you ever talked to someone about these feelings—maybe a friend, family member, or healthcare provider?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense. How do you think we can help make a difference for you?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: That makes sense. It can be a bit of an adjustment when our bodies don’t do what we expect them to.	Valid	3	4	1		
Model5: C: I feel for you. We’re going to work on your ability to transfer and that should leave you feeling more capable.	Valid	2	1	1		
P: Thank you very much.						
						
C: Hey Michelle how are you today?						
P: Hi Anastasia, I’m doing pretty well, our physio sessions together have really helped me transfer better.

Model4: C: That’s great to hear! We’ve been focusing on your balance and strength during those sessions, right?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: That’s great to hear! Last few sessions we worked on floor transfers in case you fall onto the floor. Have you practiced those at home?	Valid	3	1	1		
P: Yes, I have. Although, I am having some difficulties with them.						
Model1: C: I’m sorry to hear that. Could you share more about the specific challenges you're facing with the floor transfers? Are they related to balance, strength, or something else?	Valid	2	1	2

Model1: C: Can you tell me a bit more about the difficulties you're experiencing with the floor transfers? Are they related to balance, strength, or something else?	Valid	1	1	1

Model1: C: I see. Can you describe how much you fall and whether it feels like you're losing control during the transfer?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: I see. So you feel like you’re losing control at the end of the transfer? Have you noticed if this happens more when you're tired or in a particular environment?	Valid	3	2	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you noticed this only occurs in specific situations or environments?	Valid	3	1	1		better not to put 'make sense' because it's the patient's  experience
Model4: C: That’s a bit of an issue, can you tell me more about what happens during that transfer? Do you feel any pain or discomfort?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: I see, do you have the idea that your strength is insufficient?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: No, I don’t think so, I just think my technique needs some perfecting.						
Model1: C: That makes sense. Could you describe exactly what happens during the transfer—like, when do you feel like you’re losing control?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That makes sense. Have you noticed any specific part of the transfer where you feel less confident or have to adjust your movements?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Do you find yourself feeling anxious or frustrated when trying to transfer?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you tried using any aids or equipment to help with the transfer?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: OK. In a second, we will get to the movements but first I would like to ask some additional questions.	Valid	1	1	1

Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed any specific situations or times when this fear feels stronger?	Valid		3	3		
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed if there’s a specific movement or part of the process that feels more unstable for you?	Valid		2	2		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you ever had any falls or injuries related to transferring yourself from bed?	Valid		2	2

P: Yes, so much. And it is so frustrating. I was never a weak person and now I even need help to get out of bed.	Valid

Model5: C: How are you coping with this frustration?	Valid		3	5

Model3: C: That sounds really tough. Do you have any support system or people who can help with your daily activities?	Valid		3	3		it should be good to clarify if the patient got any support beside their partner , because otherwise it might seems like we minimaze the partner's support

Model3: C: What's that?						the question too direct too early in the conversation 
Model4: C: What was that?						the question too direct too early in the conversation 
Model5: C: Can I ask you what went wrong?						
P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. It sounds like transferring from standing to sitting on the toilet is particularly challenging for you. Have you ever used any type of support, such as a raised toilet seat or grab bars, to make this transfer easier?	Valid		1	1

Model3: C: I understand that can be a real challenge. Can you tell me more about how you're managing with transfers right now? For example, do you use any assistive devices or have someone help you?	Valid		3	2		
Model4: C: That sounds very challenging. Let me make sure I understand correctly—when you try to get off the toilet, it's not just getting up from a seated position that’s difficult for you? 	Valid		5	4		
Model5: C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound?	Valid		1	1		
P: Sounds great. Thank you so much.	Valid					
Model1: C: Before we begin, could you tell me if this difficulty with transferring from standing to sitting happens in other situations, like when you get up from a chair or into a car?	Valid		1	1

Model3: C: No problem at all, sir. Let's get started then.	Valid		3	3		
Model4: C: No problem at all. Let's get started then.	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet?	Valid		2	2		
P: I try to slowly lean forward with the help of my rollator and get into kinda a squatting position and then I would feel a bit of pain and with that I am not comfortable so I ask the nurse to help me sit down.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. It sounds like you're already using your rollator effectively to support your weight and reduce strain. Have you ever tried sitting down without the nurse’s help, even if it takes a bit longer or feels uncomfortable at first?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I see. So you’re using your rollator to help you lean forward and get into a squat position, but it still feels uncomfortable and painful. Have you noticed if there’s a particular part of the movement that causes more discomfort—like when you're leaning forward, or when you're lowering yourself down?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That sounds really challenging for you. Can we explore some strategies to make this process more manageable? For example, would using a raised toilet seat or other assistive devices be something that could help?	Valid		1	1		
Model4: C: Can you tell me more about how it feels in your abdomen when you do that? Do you feel any specific sensations or discomfort?	Valid		2	2		
Model5: C: I see your problem. Do you not trust the steadiness of your rollator or is the pain that strong that you get scared?	Valid		3	2		
P: Maybe pain is the wrong word. It is more a new uncomfortable feeling and yes the rollator has wheels so I don't trust that he holds my weight while sitting down.	Valid					
Model1: C: I understand now. It sounds like you're concerned about stability as you transition from standing to sitting. Would you feel more secure if we used the rollator for support while you practice this movement, or would you prefer to try it without the rollator first?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I understand. It sounds like you're concerned about stability and the sensation in your abdomen when transitioning. Have you tried using the rollator for support while sitting down, or do you usually rely on someone else to assist?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: I understand. Have you considered any other ways to make it easier for yourself, like using a grab bar or adjusting the height of your toilet seat?	Valid		2	2		
Model4: C: That makes sense. So the rollator is not as reliable for you in this situation, and that’s why you feel like you need someone else to help.	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: Okay, I see. I will show you how much you can trust the rollator, because trust me, the brakes are amazing and then you don't need the help of the nurse anymore and you are only dependant on the rollator.	Invalid		5	4		we do the assumption that the client only use the help of a nurse for stability reason, without asking any further about this.
P: That would be so great, because then I don't need to wait so long to go to the toilet.	Valid					
Model1: C: That sounds like a big relief for you. Let me demonstrate how to safely use the rollator during transfers so you can feel more confident and independent. Would that be okay with you?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: Exactly, and we can work on making that transition smoother and more comfortable for you. Would you be willing to try a few practice steps now with me? I’ll guide you through it slowly so you feel supported every step of the way.	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Exactly, and we can work on this together. I will be with you all the time.	Valid		2	2		supporting a client to do a specific movement is not our main task. If we claim that, it might be taken as a promise, so we will disapoint the client if we can not keep up with it.
Model4: C: Yes, exactly. Now let me try to explain this process again with a bit more detail and then we can practice it together.	Valid		2	2		we should be clear that the client can practice this with doctors or nurses and not with us in every session.
Model5: C: Do you have any help at home?	Valid		4	4		
P: No, I live still alone because my wife just passed away and before I could move in an appartement where there is help, I had to go to the hospital.	Valid					
Model1: C: I’m so sorry for your loss. It sounds like you're doing a lot on your own, and it must be challenging. Would you feel more comfortable if we practice this transfer at home, or would you prefer to start in a safer environment here?	Valid		1	1		at first we should clarify if the client wants to continue the seessions with us when he get out of the hospital.
Model2: C: I’m so sorry for your loss. That must have been very difficult. It’s understandable that you’re feeling this way, especially with the added challenge of mobility. Do you feel safe using the rollator at home by yourself?	Valid		2	2		the client did not express a way he is feeling
Model3: C: I'm so sorry for your loss. It's understandable that you need to be independent as well, but we can work together on a plan to make it easier for you.	Valid		2	3		the client did not express his views on indipendency
Model4: C: I am so sorry for your loss. It sounds like a very difficult time for you.	Valid		4	5		
Model5: C: Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. But that means as soon as your out of the hospital you will have help? Or you will still live alone for a bit?	Valid		4	4		
P: Still alone for a bit. But maybe my son will have the time to help me out.						
Model1: C: I understand. It sounds like you're managing as best as you can while waiting for support. Would it be helpful to practice transferring with the rollator in a safe environment here, so you feel more confident when you return home?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I understand. It sounds like you’re managing as best as you can, but it’s clear this situation is challenging for you. Would you feel more comfortable if we practiced using the rollator in a way that gives you greater confidence during transfers?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Alright, we'll work on your rollator and how to use it so that you can get around the house safely. We will also see if there are any other things in your home that could be made more accessible for you.	Valid		2	2		
Model4: C: That's great to hear. Well, I want you to know that we can work together and find the right solution for your needs.	Valid		4	4		
Model5: C: Please let me know until our next meeting how your situation at home will look like so I can prepare your abilities.	Valid		4	5		it's not our main task as psychologists to preper a person's mottor abilities. we could suggest them an occupational therapist in the hospital
