C: Hey, my name is Elisabeth, I will be your physiotherapist for today.						
P: Hi Elisabeth, my name Susanne, nice to meet you.

I’d like to start by asking about your experience with transferring yourself from one place to another—like moving from a bed to a chair or getting up from the floor. Can you share how that feels for you?	Valid	4	3	2		the question is too rushed and too focused on the problem to be the first question. It might be stressful for the client.
Model2: C: Thank you, Susanne. I’m looking forward to working with you. How are you feeling today?	Valid	1	1	3

P: I have had 2 total knee replacements and feel as if I never fully gained my strength back. It’s been difficult getting up from a seated position.						
Model1: C: I see. Can you describe how it feels when you try to get up from a seated position — do you experience any pain, instability, or difficulty with balance?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: I understand that can be really challenging. Can you tell me more about how it feels when you try to stand up from a seated position? Do you need assistance, or do you manage on your own?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: I see. That must be challenging for you.	Valid	1	2	2		
Model4: 	Invalid					
Model5: C: That’s unfortunate. So, it’s difficult but not impossible?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: Yeah, I’m able to stand up but it just costs me a lot of energy.						
Model1: C: I see. When you're trying to get up from a seated position, do you use any assistive devices or techniques to help you?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: I see. How does that affect your daily activities—like getting up from a chair or bed?	Valid	3	2	1		
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? For instance, how do you feel right after sitting down?	Valid	3	5	2		
Model4: C: How would you rate your strength—on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is very weak and 5 is strong?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: If I were to ask you to repeatedly stand up and sit back down, how many times do you reckon you could do it?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: I think I could do about 4 back to back.						
Model1: C: That’s helpful to know. Do you ever feel anxious or frustrated when trying to get up from a seated position, especially in situations where you don’t have much time or support?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That’s a good number. And when you’re doing those movements, do you feel any specific areas of your body working harder or causing more discomfort?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: Alright. What makes it harder for you when trying to get up from a seated position?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: That sounds like a fair amount. Do you find it more challenging in the morning or evening?	Valid	3	1	1		
Model5: C: And each and everyone one of those feels physically demanding?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: Yeah, they do.						
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed any particular situations or times of day when this feels even more challenging?	Valid	1	1	1

Model3: C: It sounds like there's a real challenge with the act of getting up from sitting, especially after your knee surgery. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to stand? Do you feel any pain or discomfort in particular areas?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: Have you ever had a situation where the act of getting up was more challenging or dangerous?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: Purely from out your muscles or do you also get out of breath?	Valid	2	2	1		
P: A bit of both but primarily the muscles.						
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed if there’s a particular time of day when this feels more challenging, like in the morning or after sitting for a while?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: And when you’re sitting, do you find it hard to stand up from a chair or more so from the floor?	Invalid	5	5	2

Model5: C: How do you feel about your situation?	Valid	2	2	1		
P: I’m afraid of getting old and I feel as if this may be this first signs that I am at that point in my life.						
Model1: C: That sounds really challenging, both physically and emotionally. Do you feel that this fear of aging is affecting your confidence in doing everyday activities?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That sounds really heavy, Susanne. It must be difficult to feel like you’re losing your strength and independence. Have you noticed anything else that makes this feeling worse or more concerning?	Valid	1	2	2		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you had any support from family or friends who could help with some of these tasks?	Valid	1	1	1		the answer is not in line with client's emotion.
Model4: C: That’s understandable. But it sounds like you have a support system around you.	Valid	2	2	1		we should say why we're making this observation
Model5: C: Do you feel like your age?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: No not really, I feel much older than I actually am. I feel as if my body should be much more capable at 63 years old.						
Model1: C: That sounds really frustrating. Have you ever talked to someone about these feelings before?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That sounds really frustrating. Have you ever talked to someone about these feelings—maybe a friend, family member, or healthcare provider?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense. How do you think we can help make a difference for you?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: That makes sense. It can be a bit of an adjustment when our bodies don’t do what we expect them to.	Valid	3	4	1		
Model5: C: I feel for you. We’re going to work on your ability to transfer and that should leave you feeling more capable.	Valid	2	1	1		
P: Thank you very much.

Model2: C: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m glad we’re making progress. How has your ability to move around in your home been lately?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: That’s great to hear! Can you tell me a bit more about what it was like transferring before we started working on that together?	Valid	3	3	1		
Model4: C: That’s great to hear! We’ve been focusing on your balance and strength during those sessions, right?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: That’s great to hear! Last few sessions we worked on floor transfers in case you fall onto the floor. Have you practiced those at home?	Valid	3	1	1

Model1: C: Can you tell me a bit more about the difficulties you're experiencing with the floor transfers? Are they related to balance, strength, or something else?	Valid	1	1	1

Model5: C: Alright so let’s start off with the difficulties you mentioned having.	Valid	1				
P: Yeah, so what’s been happening is when I transfer from my wheelchair down to the ground, everything goes well but at the end I let myself fall a bit too much.						
Model1: C: I see. Can you describe how much you fall and whether it feels like you're losing control during the transfer?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: I see. So you feel like you’re losing control at the end of the transfer? Have you noticed if this happens more when you're tired or in a particular environment?	Valid	3	2	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you noticed this only occurs in specific situations or environments?	Valid	3	1	1		better not to put 'make sense' because it's the patient's  experience
Model4: C: That’s a bit of an issue, can you tell me more about what happens during that transfer? Do you feel any pain or discomfort?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: I see, do you have the idea that your strength is insufficient?	Valid	1	1	1		
P: No, I don’t think so, I just think my technique needs some perfecting.						
Model1: C: That makes sense. Could you describe exactly what happens during the transfer—like, when do you feel like you’re losing control?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model2: C: That makes sense. Have you noticed any specific part of the transfer where you feel less confident or have to adjust your movements?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Do you find yourself feeling anxious or frustrated when trying to transfer?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you tried using any aids or equipment to help with the transfer?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model5: C: OK. In a second, we will get to the movements but first I would like to ask some additional questions.	Valid	1	1	1		
P: That’s fine by me						
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about the environment where you practice these transfers—like whether the floor is smooth, if there’s any cushioning, or if you have support from someone nearby?	Valid	1	2	1		
Model2: C: Do you feel any particular discomfort or pain during the transfer, such as in your arms, shoulders, or back?	Valid	1	1	1		
Model3: C: How are you feeling about these sessions? Do they make any sense to you?	Valid	3	3	1		
Model4: C: Can you tell me a bit more about your experience transferring from the wheelchair? For example, is it easier or harder for certain surfaces like carpets, hardwood floors?	Valid	1	2	1
