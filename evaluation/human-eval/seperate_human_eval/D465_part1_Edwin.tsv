P: I tried to get around the house yesterday, but I couldn’t move forward.							
Model1: C: Did you try using any specific techniques or adjustments to help move forward?	Valid	2	1	1

Model4: C: That’s a really frustrating situation. Are there specific surfaces or positions that make it more difficult for you to use your wheelchair?	Valid	2	2	1			
Model5: C: That sounds discouraging. Is there any pain when you try and move forwards or is it purely a strength issue?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: No pain, just not enough arm strength to propel myself forwards.							
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed if this weakness is consistent, or does it vary depending on the time of day or activity?	Valid	2	2	1			
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your arm strength recently, or is this something that has been ongoing?	Valid	1	1	1

Model5: C: Understood. So, how have you been moving around your house.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I have a lovely neighbor who comes and moves me when I ring his phone.							
Model1: C: That’s very thoughtful of your neighbor. How often do they come to assist you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s really thoughtful of your neighbor. How often do you need assistance with moving around the house?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That’s wonderful! You must be lucky to have such a helpful neighbor.	Valid	1	3	5			
Model4: C: That’s really thoughtful of him. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to move around over the last few weeks or months?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model5: C: That sounds like a great neighbor.	Valid	1	3	5

Model1: C: I’m glad you have support. Have you noticed any changes in your arm strength lately, or is this something that’s been ongoing?	Valid	2	1	1

P: I feel as if I have no autonomy at all. It was already horrible that I ended up in this wheelchair and now I can’t even use it. I can’t do anything							
Model1: C: That must be really frustrating and overwhelming. It sounds like you’re feeling a loss of control over your own life. Have you ever talked to anyone about how you’re feeling?	Valid	1	3	3

Model2: C: Nice to meet you, Alexandra. How can I help you today?	Valid	1	1	1

Model4: C: What brings you here today, Emma?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Great, thanks for sharing. Have you been having a good day so far?	Valid	3	5	5			
P: I’m a bit tired							
Model1: C: I understand, rest is important. Can you tell me a bit more about what makes you tired? Is it related to any specific activities or movements?	Valid	1	3	3			
Model2: C: I see. Do you feel tired from any specific activity today, or is it more of a general fatigue?	Valid	1	1	5			
Model3: C: That makes sense with the weather we’ve been having. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today? What’s your main concern?							
Model4: C: Sorry to hear that. Did you have any trouble getting out of bed this morning or doing your usual routine?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: I hear you. Let’s take it at your pace today.	Valid	1	2	3			
P: OK.							
Model1: C: I want to make sure we cover what’s most important to you today. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with moving around, either at home or when going out?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model2: C: So, Alexandra, I understand you're feeling a bit tired today. Could you tell me more about what’s been going on with your mobility lately? Are there any specific activities that feel challenging for you right now?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Can you tell me a bit more about what brings you here today? What seems to be the main issue or concern for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today? What seems to be the main issue for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: I saw that you had some issues coming into the clinic room. Have been having issues moving around with your walking stick.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: It's been a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. I can’t really manage on my own.							
Model1: C: I understand. Can you tell me more about how it feels when you try to move around with your walking stick — do you feel frustrated or anxious at times?	Valid	1	2	1			
Model2: C: I see. Can you tell me more about what’s been challenging with the walking stick?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about what’s going on? What do you mean by ‘mixed bag’?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Can you tell me more about what’s been challenging for you lately? Is it getting around or doing specific tasks?	Valid	1	2	2			
Model5: C: What’s holding you back from using it independently?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: I can stay balanced when I’m still, but when start to take a few steps I feel really unsteady.							
Model1: C: That sounds challenging. Do you feel more unsteady on certain types of surfaces, like carpet versus tile?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds challenging. Do you feel like your legs are weak, or is it more about balance and coordination?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you had any falls or near-falls recently?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That sounds like a challenge. Is there something specific that makes it harder for you to move around with your walking stick?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: So, if I’m understanding it correctly, your balance is the limiting factor.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Definitely balance. I feel like I’ll tip sideways, especially if there’s any uneven pavement. That’s why I always need my husband to walk beside me and hold my other arm.							
Model1: C: That makes sense. Do you feel more confident using your walking stick on smooth, even surfaces, or is it difficult even in familiar environments?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds really challenging. Have you noticed if certain surfaces or environments make this more difficult than others?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you had any falls or near-falls recently that might have made this worse?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you tried using any other equipment—like a rollator or even just taking breaks to rest?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Are you always afraid of falling?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Pretty much. I’ve tried going alone a few steps outside the house, but I get too nervous. If my husband is not there to hold on to, I just don’t feel safe.							
Model1: C: It sounds like your fear of falling is really impacting your confidence and independence. Have you ever spoken to a healthcare professional about this concern?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model2: C: I understand how frightening that must be. Have you ever considered using a mobility aid that offers more support, like a rollator or a wheeled walker?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That makes sense. It sounds like your independence is also affected by the fear of falling.	Valid	1	1	2			
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you ever considered using any other mobility device—like a rollator or even a lightweight wheelchair?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: I get how you’re feeling. How do you feel about your inability to independently walk down the street with your walking stick?	Valid	2	2	1			
P: Its obviously quite annoying having to rely on another person to do such a simple task, although, secretly I don’t mind. It gives me a good excuse to hold onto my husband.							
Model1: C: That’s a very honest perspective. It sounds like there's both a practical need and an emotional comfort in having your husband support you. Have you ever considered using any additional equipment or strategies to help build your confidence walking independently?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model2: C: That’s a funny way to put it—but I can see how it might feel comforting to have that support. Do you ever worry about how this reliance affects your confidence or independence?	Valid	1	2	2			
Model3: C: That’s a very practical way of looking at it! It sounds like you and your husband have developed some sort of routine together that works for both of you.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That’s a very practical approach! Do you feel like your husband is always willing to help?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model5: C: I appreciate your honesty. It makes perfect sense to find comfort in having that support even while wanting more independence.	Valid	3	1	1			
P: I’m glad you understand.							
							
C: Hi, I’m Jordan, your physiotherapist today.							
P: Hello Jordan, I’m Maria. Nice to meet you.							
Model1: C: Thank you for coming in today, Maria. I’d like to start by understanding a bit more about your mobility and how it impacts your daily life. Could you tell me a little about any challenges you’ve noticed when moving around or transferring from one place to another?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model2: C: Nice to meet you, Maria. How are you feeling today?	Valid	1	2	2			
Model3: C: Nice to meet you too, Maria. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?	Valid	1	1	1

Model5: C: Nice to meet you too, Maria. Do you mind telling me your age?	Valid	3	3	5			
P: I’m 72.							
Model1: C: Thank you, Maria. Can you tell me a bit about why you're here today? Are you experiencing any difficulty with moving around or transferring yourself?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: Great, thanks Maria. I understand you’re here today because of some mobility concerns? Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Alright, Maria. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?	Valid	1	1	2			
Model4: C: And how have you been feeling lately?	Valid	1	3	2			
Model5: C: Thank you. How has your day been so far?	Valid	2	4	5			
P: I’m a little out of breath.							
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed this shortness of breath when moving around, or is it more constant?	Valid	1	2	5			
Model2: C: I see. Have you been experiencing shortness of breath for long, or has it come on recently?	Valid	1	3	5			
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? What makes it hard for you to breathe?	Valid	1	3	5			
Model4: C: Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on?	Valid	2	3	5			
Model5: C: I noticed you struggled a bit when you walked in with your walker, does it have anything to do with that?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: It does, I’ve been having issues moving around with my walker.							
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about the difficulties you're experiencing with your walker—do you find it hard to get up or down, or is there a particular situation that makes it harder?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: Can you tell me more about what’s been difficult with your walker? For example, do you have trouble with balance, or does it feel like it's not supporting you enough?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about what’s been challenging for you lately? Is it the walking itself or something else?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Can you tell me more about what’s not working for you? Is it the balance, or is there something specific that makes it hard?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: Please, tell me what you are struggling with.	Valid	2	1	2			
P: I manage getting around, but I get wobbly on corners and when I change direction.							
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed if this wobbling is more frequent in certain environments, like on carpeted floors or smooth tiles?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds challenging. Have you noticed if this happens more on certain surfaces, like carpet or tile?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you ever had any falls or near-falls due to your balance issues?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model4: C: That sounds challenging. Can you tell me a bit more about it—like, is there any specific surface that makes this harder for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: So, your walker provides sufficient support, but turning and balancing remain challenging?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Exactly. I can get from the living room to the kitchen, but I have to stop and steady myself several times.							
Model1: C: That sounds frustrating. Have you noticed if this wobbling happens more in certain environments, like on carpet versus hardwood?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds frustrating. Have you noticed if the wobbling happens more on certain surfaces, like carpets or hardwood?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That must be frustrating. Can you tell me more about the situations where it’s harder for you?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model4: C: That sounds very frustrating. Have you ever had any falls or close calls with your walker?	Valid	2	1	1			
Model5: C: Understood. Would you say that stopping to regain balance is your main difficulty?	Valid	1	1	1			
P: Yes, I feel like I’m nearly falling every time I pivot.							
Model1: C: That sounds very concerning, Maria. Have you noticed if this happens more in certain environments, like on smooth floors or when there’s less space to move?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds really concerning. Have you noticed if this happens more on certain surfaces, like carpet versus hardwood?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: That sounds really concerning. Have you noticed any specific situations or surfaces where this becomes more difficult for you?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: That sounds concerning. Do you find it hard to get from one room to another, or is the issue more with turning and balancing?	Valid	3	1	1			
Model5: C: How do you feel about your condition?	Valid	2	2	2			
P: I’m scared to death. I had a nightmare where I fell whilst using my walker. That can’t be sign that it’ll actually happen right?							
Model1: C: That sounds very frightening, Maria. It’s completely normal to feel anxious when there's a fear of falling — it can really impact how confident we feel moving around. Have you noticed if your anxiety affects how you use your walker or your ability to move independently?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model2: C: That sounds really frightening, Maria. Nightmares like that can be a sign of anxiety around mobility, which is totally normal given what you’re going through. Have you noticed any changes in your confidence or mood since these worries started?	Invalid				it's ethical unjustified for C to explain dreams in this manner		
Model3: C: No, of course not. But it sounds like you’re worried and would benefit from some extra support or maybe even a different type of walker.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: Of course not. But let’s work together to find something that will make you feel more secure and independent.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model5: C: I’m sure it was just a nightmare. With the right approach we can improve your ability to more around with your walker.	Valid	1	1	1			
P: That’s all I want. I want to move more freely. I have had enough of all this worriment							
Model1: C: That’s a strong and important feeling, Maria. It sounds like you’re ready to take steps toward greater confidence and independence. Can you tell me what would make you feel more secure when using your walker?	Valid	2	2	1			
Model2: C: That’s a strong and honest feeling—wanting to move more freely and not be held back by worry. It takes courage to face these challenges, Maria. Can you tell me what would help you feel more confident when turning or changing direction with your walker?	Valid	1	1	1			
Model3: C: We’ll work together to achieve that, Maria.	Valid	1	1	1			
Model4: C: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the changes and challenges. Can you tell me more about what worries you most? Is it losing your independence, or something else entirely?	Valid	2	5	2			
Model5: C: That is understandable. Let’s get started.	Valid	2	2	1			
P: Agreed.							
							
C: Hey there, welcome! I’m Hazel, your physiotherapist.							
P: Hi Hazel, I’m Diego. Good to meet you.

Model3: C: I’m doing well, thanks for asking. How have you been feeling lately? Any changes in your daily routine or anything that’s been bothering you?	Valid		3	3			
Model4: C: I’m doing well, thank you. How are your days going?	Invalid						
Model5: C: Neither can I. Before we dive in, how old are you if you don’t mind sharing?	Invalid						
P: I’m 68.							
Model1: C: Thank you, Diego. At 68, are there any specific activities or tasks that you find challenging when moving around or using your hands?	Valid		3	3			
Model2: C: 68, you're still in the prime of your life! So, Diego, how can I help you today?	Valid		3	5			
Model3: C: Alright, so let’s get started then. How would you rate your overall mobility? 1 to 5, with 1 being very difficult and 5 being easy.	Valid		2	3			
Model4: C: Alright, well welcome to our clinic. What brings you here today?	Valid		3	5			
Model5: C: Alright so based on your file, I can see that you had hip replacement surgery, Is that correct?	Valid		3	5			
P: Yes, it is.							
Model1: C: Great, Diego. I’d like to understand more about how your daily activities are going. Have you had any difficulty transferring yourself from a seated to a standing position lately?	Valid		1	3			
Model2: C: Great, thanks for confirming. So, how have you been feeling since the surgery? Are you managing well with daily activities?	Valid		1	3			
Model3: C: Great! We’ll focus on your recovery from that surgery. Can you tell me a bit more about what brings you here today? What are some of the challenges or difficulties you've been experiencing?	Valid		2	5			
Model4: C: Good to confirm. So, what brings you in today? What seems like the main issue?	Valid		4	5			
Model5: C: I also noticed you came in on your crutches. Did they teach you how to use them in the hospital?	Valid		1	1			
P: Yeah, they did.							
Model1: C: Great, that’s good to hear. When you’re using the crutches, do you feel confident moving around your home or are there any specific areas where you find it challenging?	Valid		1	1			
Model2: C: Great, that’s good to know. How have you been managing with them so far?	Valid		1	1			
Model3: C: Great. Can you tell me a bit more about what happens when you try to get up from your bed or chair? How are those transfers for you?	Valid		1	3			
Model4: C: Good. So, what brings you here today?	Valid		3	5			
Model5: C: How has using them been since your hip surgery. I see in your file the surgery was 1 month ago.	Valid		1	1			
P: I manage well. I can move around the house and even up and down the porch steps without help.							
Model1: C: That sounds good, Diego. Have you had any difficulty using the crutches in other settings, like when you’re out and about or going to appointments?	Valid		2	1			
Model2: C: That sounds great! How about when you go out—like to the grocery store or park? Do you feel confident using the crutches outside?	Valid		1	1			
Model3: C: That sounds great! Have you ever had trouble with balance or getting tired easily when using your crutches?	Valid		1	1			
Model4: C: That’s great! Have you found any difficulties with your crutches—like uneven surfaces or turns?	Valid		1	1			
Model5: C: That’s excellent progress. Does the hip stiffness ever slow you down?	Valid		1	1			
P: No not really. It’s mainly my palms that start hurting once I’ve been moving around with my crutches for too long.							
Model1: C: I see. So the discomfort is more in your palms rather than your hip? Have you noticed any specific activities or times of day when the palm pain tends to get worse?	Valid		1	1			
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed any specific activities that make your palms hurt more, like gripping the crutches for long periods or doing things that require a firm grip?	Valid		1	2			
Model3: C: I see. And what about using your crutches on uneven surfaces or stairs? Have you had any trouble with that?	Valid		1	1			
Model4: C: Alright, so we need to explore more about your mobility and how the crutches are affecting you. Can I ask a question then?	Valid		2	1			
Model5: C: How quickly does that pain start to arise and what do you do to make it go away.	Valid		1	4			
P: It comes after about 20 minutes. I don’t need to do much for it to go away. Just a short rest							
Model1: C: That’s good to hear. Do you find that the pain affects how you move or use your hands during daily activities?	Valid		1	2			
Model2: C: That’s helpful to know. Do you ever feel like the crutches are making your hands or wrists uncomfortable in other ways?	Valid		1	2			
Model3: C: That’s interesting. So, you have a bit of discomfort but it doesn’t limit your daily activities too much.	Valid		1	2			
Model4: C: That’s great that you have a good sense of your body. How about when we move to the next step, which is transferring from the bed or wheelchair? Do you find it challenging?	Valid		3	3			
Model5: C: So, you’re essentially fully independent with crutches, with just minor pain in the palms after 20 minutes	Valid		1	1			
P: Exactly.							
Model1: C: That sounds like a good balance of mobility and manageable discomfort. Have you noticed if the palm pain affects your ability to do daily activities or go out?	Valid		4	3			
Model2: C: That’s great to hear. Have you noticed any specific activities that make the palm pain worse? Like gripping or pushing the crutches for longer periods?	Valid		1	3			
Model3: C: That’s great progress, Diego. How have you been managing your daily activities since surgery? Any challenges or difficulties?	Valid		2	3			
Model4: C: That’s very good. Have you had any trouble with your balance or coordination since the surgery?	Valid		3	3			
Model5: C: With regard to the hip, I asked about stiffness but do you have any pain.	Valid		2	5			
P: A little yes. It’s a sort of dull aching pain that typically comes if I push too far. Nothing I can’t handle.							
Model1: C: Got it. So the dull ache in your hip is more about overexertion rather than constant pain. Does that affect how far or how long you can move around with your crutches?	Valid		1	1			
Model2: C: That’s good to hear it's manageable. Have you noticed any specific activities or times of day when the hip pain tends to be more bothersome?	Valid		2	5			
Model3: C: How do you feel about needing to use crutches, Diego?	Valid		1	1			
Model4: C: That’s good to know. What are your plans for the future in terms of mobility? Any changes or goals you have?	Valid		1	2			
Model5: C: Despite how well you’re managing to move around with your crutches, I can imagine that you’re looking forward to the day you can go without.	Valid		1	1			
P: Yeah, it’s been way too long. I’m grateful for how well I’m doing but I can’t wait until I’m properly on my feet again.							
Model1: C: I understand completely, Diego. It’s natural to feel that way. Have you thought about what activities or places you’d most like to be able to go without assistance?	Valid		1	1			
Model2: C: That makes sense. Have you thought about what activities or places you’d like to return to once you’re able to walk without crutches?	Valid		1	1			
Model3: C: It sounds like you have a good support system in place, with family and friends helping out when needed.	Valid		3	3			
Model4: C: That makes sense. We’ll work together to get you there, Diego.	Valid		1	2			
Model5: C: Refresh my memory, when did the surgeon say you could go without?	Valid		1	1			
P: 17 days from now. I can survive another 2 and a half weeks.							
Model1: C: That’s a long time to wait, especially with the palm pain you’re experiencing. Have you thought about any ways to manage the crutch use more comfortably in the meantime?	Valid		1	2			
Model2: C: That’s a long time to wait, isn’t it? Have you thought about how you might manage in the meantime—like using a cane or even a walking frame if needed?	Valid		1	1			
Model3: C: That sounds like a very good plan. Well, Diego it was lovely talking with you today and I’m really looking forward to seeing how your recovery progresses.	Valid		1	5			
Model4: C: Alright so 17 days is your target for getting back to walking without crutches. That’s great news.	Valid		1	1			
Model5: C: That I am sure of.	Valid		1	5
