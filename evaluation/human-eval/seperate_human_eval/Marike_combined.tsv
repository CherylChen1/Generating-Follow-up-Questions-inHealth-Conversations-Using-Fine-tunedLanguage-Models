Model5: C: I'm sorry about that. Could you get up with help?	Valid		1	2		
P: Yes, but I don't like it. I don't want to rely on others. I need to be able to go at least where I want to go.	Valid					emotion about functioninng

Model5: C: I see that. Are you able to do anything with the wheelchair by yourself?	Valid		2	3		it might be taken wrong, as an assumption that the client can not manage his wheelchair

Model3: C: That's a challenge. Do you have any equipment or tools that might help with transfers?	Valid		1	1		
Model4: C: That must be very frustrating. Do you find that your ability to move around with the wheelchair has improved in any way? For example, are there specific tasks or activities where you feel more confident now?	Valid		3	3		we should say what is our base for asking this question (e.g.  a client's saying in previous sessions)
Model5: C: I see. So we will need to work on your strength, so you will be less dependant on your son.	Valid		3	3		better avoid to express about dependency or indipendency
P: That sounds like a good plan. I am sick of feeling so weak.	Valid					
Model1: C: I hear you, and it's great that you're motivated to make changes. Have you thought about what kind of support or resources might help you feel more independent in the meantime?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I hear you, and it’s great that you’re motivated to work on your strength. Have you noticed any specific activities or movements that feel more manageable than others?	Valid		1	2		
Model3: C: We'll work together to get you stronger and more independent.	Valid		2	2		
Model4: C: It is a good plan. How do you feel about needing to use more assistance or relying on your son for help?	Valid		4	3

P: I can't live without her now. Thank god he's still strong, but he has bad eyesight. We are supporting each other.	Valid					
Model1: C: I appreciate you sharing that. How does it feel to rely on your partner for support, especially with his eyesight being an issue?	Valid		1	3

C: Good morning, I am Annabelle and I will take care of you this morning. What is your name?						We should clarify our role
P: Good morning, my name is Heinz.						
Model1: C: Good morning, Heinz. I'm Annabelle, and I'll be helping you today with your mobility assessment. Could you tell me a bit about how you usually get around at home?						this question is too early in the conversation and before we ask the patient about their concerns
Model2: C: Nice to meet you, Heinz. How are you feeling today?						
Model3: C: Nice to meet you, Heinz. How old are you?						
Model4: C: Nice to meet you, Heinz. How old are you?						
Model5: C: Nice to meet you Heinz. How are you doing today?						
P: I am not doing so good. I am scared of going outside of my bed, because my legs feel so weak.	Valid					
Model1: C: I'm sorry to hear that, Heinz. It sounds like your legs feel very weak, which makes it hard for you to move around. Can you tell me more about when you feel this weakness — is it constant, or does it get worse at certain times of day?	Valid		2	2		
Model2: C: I’m sorry to hear that, Heinz. It sounds like you're feeling quite limited in your movement right now. Can you tell me more about how your legs feel—do they feel heavy, or is it more like a loss of strength?	Valid		2	3		
Model3: user	Invalid					
Model4: C: I see. That sounds really tough, Heinz. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on? What have you noticed that makes it hard for you to get out of bed?	Valid		2	1		
Model5: C: I am sorry to hear that. Do you feel comfortable to leave your bed with a bit of help?	Valid		2	1		
P: Yes, with a bit of help it is alright. But I really wanna build up my abilities to leave my bed on my own.	Valid					
Model1: C: That’s a great goal, Heinz. Can you tell me more about what makes it difficult for you to leave your bed on your own?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: That’s a great goal, Heinz. Can you tell me how often you try to get out of bed on your own, and what happens when you attempt it?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That's a great goal! Can you tell me more about what makes it hard for you to get out of bed? Is there anything in particular that triggers the fear or weakness?	Valid		1	1		
Model4: C: That sounds like a great goal for you. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to get out of bed?	Valid		2	1		
Model5: C: Understandable. For this morning I will help you and then we will build up your strength together.	Valid		3	3		
P: Sounds great. Thank you.	Valid					
Model1: C: I'm glad to hear that. Would you feel comfortable sharing a bit more about what makes you want to build up your abilities to leave your bed on your own?	Valid		3	3		
Model2: C: Before we start, can you tell me a bit about what makes it difficult for you to get out of bed on your own?	Valid		2	2		it should be better to add 'beside the leg's weakness' to saw the client we really listened them
Model3: C: You're welcome! Before we begin, can you tell me a bit more about how your legs feel? Do they ache or have any numbness?	Valid		2	3		
Model4: C: Now, let’s get started with some exercises to help you feel stronger.	Valid		1	3		
Model5: C: With which part of getting out of bed do you have the most problems?	Valid		1	1		
P: Honnestly with putting myself in a seated position.						
Model1: C: I see. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when trying to sit up, or is it more about the strength and coordination?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I see. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when trying to sit up, or is it more about the effort it takes?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Do you have any difficulty transferring from your bed to a chair or wheelchair?	Valid		3	2		
Model4: C: Okay, I see. Can you explain more about that? Like what specifically makes it hard for you?	Valid		1	3		
Model5: C: Why do you think that is the hardest?	Valid		5	4		
P: I don't trust my abdominal strength, that is why I have the feeling that I will fall over as soon as I am seated.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed any specific situations or times when this fear feels stronger?	Valid		3	3		
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed if there’s a specific movement or part of the process that feels more unstable for you?	Valid		2	2		
Model3: C: That makes sense. Have you ever had any falls or injuries related to transferring yourself from bed?	Valid		2	2		
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you ever had a situation where your legs felt very weak and you were worried about falling?	Valid		4	3		
Model5: C: And do you feel like you will fall over to the front, back or to one side?	Valid		1	1		
P: To the front most parts and a bit to the side.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed if this feeling of instability changes depending on the time of day or if it's consistent?	Valid		2	2		
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed if there’s anything that helps you feel more stable when trying to sit up—like using a pillow or leaning against something?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Do you think that using a supportive device like a walker or cane would make it easier for you?	Invalid		5	3		
Model4: C: How do you feel about being in a seated position for any length of time?	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: Do you have the same feeling when you are standing or is it just like that when you are seated?	Valid		1	1		
P: While standing it is even worse because my legs feel so weak.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. It sounds like both your core stability and leg strength are contributing to this fear. Have you noticed if there’s anything specific that makes the feeling better or worse when you’re trying to stand or sit?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: That’s important to know. Have you noticed if there are any specific times or situations when this feeling is more intense—like after resting, right after waking up, or during the day?	Valid		2	2		
Model3: C: That sounds very challenging. Do you feel anxious about not being able to move around on your own?	Valid		3	3		the client did not say about not being able to move,so we should not make this assumption
Model4: C: How often do you try to get out of bed?	Valid		5	4		
Model5: C: Are you dependant an your significant other for help?	Valid		4	4		
P: Yes, so much. And it is so frustrating. I was never a weak person and now I even need help to get out of bed.	Valid					
Model1: C: It sounds like this is a big change for you, and I can see how frustrating it must be. Have you noticed any specific situations or times when the fear of falling feels more intense?	Valid		1	2		
Model2: C: I hear you, Heinz. It must be really frustrating to feel like you’ve lost some of your independence. Have you noticed any specific situations or times when this fear feels stronger?	Valid		1	2		client did not express their views on indipendancy
Model3: C: That must be very difficult for you. Do you have any support from friends or family members who can help with your mobility?	Valid		2	3		
Model4: C: That must be really tough for you.	Valid		4	5		
Model5: C: How are you coping with this frustration?	Valid		3	5		
P: Honnestly I cry a lot and need a lot of affection and good words from my partner. Without her I could not do it. She is an angle.	Valid					
Model1: C: It sounds like your partner plays a very important role in your recovery. Have you considered involving her more directly in your rehabilitation process, or would that be difficult?	Valid		1	2		
Model2: C: Thank you for sharing that with me, Heinz. It sounds like your partner is incredibly supportive and important to you. Have you ever thought about how this situation might be affecting your confidence or self-esteem?	Valid		1	3		
Model3: C: That sounds really tough. Do you have any support system or people who can help with your daily activities?	Valid		3	3		it should be good to clarify if the patient got any support beside their partner , because otherwise it might seems like we minimaze the partner's support
Model4: C: That is very touching. Do you think your partner could be with us today to help out?	Valid		3	3		better to ask if the client woulb be ok with this.
Model5: C: It is good to hear that you have so much support. And I am sure we will get you stronger in the coming weaks so you have it easier leaving your bed.	Valid		2	1		
P: That would be amazing.						
						
C: Good evening sir. How was your day?						
P: Hello. My day was quite nice except for one thing.						
Model1: C: I'm glad to hear your day was mostly pleasant. Could you tell me more about the one thing that didn't go as well?						
Model2: C: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more about what was bothering you?						
Model3: C: What's that?						the question too direct too early in the conversation 
Model4: C: What was that?						the question too direct too early in the conversation 
Model5: C: Can I ask you what went wrong?						
P: Of course, maybe you can also help me. I don't like to admit it, but getting from standing on to sitting on the toilet is so painful and almost impossible to do on my own. I don't know how to place my arms so I don't put pressure on my abdominal part where it hurts when I use the muscles.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. It sounds like transferring from standing to sitting on the toilet is particularly challenging for you. Have you ever used any type of support, such as a raised toilet seat or grab bars, to make this transfer easier?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I’m so sorry to hear that’s been such a struggle. It sounds like you’re working really hard to manage this on your own. Have you tried using any kind of support—like a raised toilet seat or a transfer bench?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: I understand that can be a real challenge. Can you tell me more about how you're managing with transfers right now? For example, do you use any assistive devices or have someone help you?	Valid		3	2		
Model4: C: That sounds very challenging. Let me make sure I understand correctly—when you try to get off the toilet, it's not just getting up from a seated position that’s difficult for you? 	Valid		5	4		
Model5: C: Thank you for sharing your difficulty with that process. We can do it now together and I can show you what the best position is to not tense up your abdominal muscles and then you can try it on your own under my supervision. How does that sound?	Valid		1	1		
P: Sounds great. Thank you so much.	Valid					
Model1: C: Before we begin, could you tell me if this difficulty with transferring from standing to sitting happens in other situations, like when you get up from a chair or into a car?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I'm glad to hear that. Before we start, could you tell me if this difficulty has affected how often you're able to go to the bathroom or if it’s something that comes up more frequently during certain times of day?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: No problem at all, sir. Let's get started then.	Valid		3	3		
Model4: C: No problem at all. Let's get started then.	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: Now you are standing. How would you proceed further to sit down on the toilet?	Valid		2	2		
P: I try to slowly lean forward with the help of my rollator and get into kinda a squatting position and then I would feel a bit of pain and with that I am not comfortable so I ask the nurse to help me sit down.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. It sounds like you're already using your rollator effectively to support your weight and reduce strain. Have you ever tried sitting down without the nurse’s help, even if it takes a bit longer or feels uncomfortable at first?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I see. So you’re using your rollator to help you lean forward and get into a squat position, but it still feels uncomfortable and painful. Have you noticed if there’s a particular part of the movement that causes more discomfort—like when you're leaning forward, or when you're lowering yourself down?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That sounds really challenging for you. Can we explore some strategies to make this process more manageable? For example, would using a raised toilet seat or other assistive devices be something that could help?	Valid		1	1		
Model4: C: Can you tell me more about how it feels in your abdomen when you do that? Do you feel any specific sensations or discomfort?	Valid		2	2		
Model5: C: I see your problem. Do you not trust the steadiness of your rollator or is the pain that strong that you get scared?	Valid		3	2		
P: Maybe pain is the wrong word. It is more a new uncomfortable feeling and yes the rollator has wheels so I don't trust that he holds my weight while sitting down.	Valid					
Model1: C: I understand now. It sounds like you're concerned about stability as you transition from standing to sitting. Would you feel more secure if we used the rollator for support while you practice this movement, or would you prefer to try it without the rollator first?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I understand. It sounds like you're concerned about stability and the sensation in your abdomen when transitioning. Have you tried using the rollator for support while sitting down, or do you usually rely on someone else to assist?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: I understand. Have you considered any other ways to make it easier for yourself, like using a grab bar or adjusting the height of your toilet seat?	Valid		2	2		
Model4: C: That makes sense. So the rollator is not as reliable for you in this situation, and that’s why you feel like you need someone else to help.	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: Okay, I see. I will show you how much you can trust the rollator, because trust me, the brakes are amazing and then you don't need the help of the nurse anymore and you are only dependant on the rollator.	Invalid		5	4		we do the assumption that the client only use the help of a nurse for stability reason, without asking any further about this.
P: That would be so great, because then I don't need to wait so long to go to the toilet.	Valid					
Model1: C: That sounds like a big relief for you. Let me demonstrate how to safely use the rollator during transfers so you can feel more confident and independent. Would that be okay with you?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: Exactly, and we can work on making that transition smoother and more comfortable for you. Would you be willing to try a few practice steps now with me? I’ll guide you through it slowly so you feel supported every step of the way.	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Exactly, and we can work on this together. I will be with you all the time.	Valid		2	2		supporting a client to do a specific movement is not our main task. If we claim that, it might be taken as a promise, so we will disapoint the client if we can not keep up with it.
Model4: C: Yes, exactly. Now let me try to explain this process again with a bit more detail and then we can practice it together.	Valid		2	2		we should be clear that the client can practice this with doctors or nurses and not with us in every session.
Model5: C: Do you have any help at home?	Valid		4	4		
P: No, I live still alone because my wife just passed away and before I could move in an appartement where there is help, I had to go to the hospital.	Valid					
Model1: C: I’m so sorry for your loss. It sounds like you're doing a lot on your own, and it must be challenging. Would you feel more comfortable if we practice this transfer at home, or would you prefer to start in a safer environment here?	Valid		1	1		at first we should clarify if the client wants to continue the seessions with us when he get out of the hospital.
Model2: C: I’m so sorry for your loss. That must have been very difficult. It’s understandable that you’re feeling this way, especially with the added challenge of mobility. Do you feel safe using the rollator at home by yourself?	Valid		2	2		the client did not express a way he is feeling
Model3: C: I'm so sorry for your loss. It's understandable that you need to be independent as well, but we can work together on a plan to make it easier for you.	Valid		2	3		the client did not express his views on indipendency
Model4: C: I am so sorry for your loss. It sounds like a very difficult time for you.	Valid		4	5		
Model5: C: Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. But that means as soon as your out of the hospital you will have help? Or you will still live alone for a bit?	Valid		4	4		
P: Still alone for a bit. But maybe my son will have the time to help me out.						
Model1: C: I understand. It sounds like you're managing as best as you can while waiting for support. Would it be helpful to practice transferring with the rollator in a safe environment here, so you feel more confident when you return home?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I understand. It sounds like you’re managing as best as you can, but it’s clear this situation is challenging for you. Would you feel more comfortable if we practiced using the rollator in a way that gives you greater confidence during transfers?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Alright, we'll work on your rollator and how to use it so that you can get around the house safely. We will also see if there are any other things in your home that could be made more accessible for you.	Valid		2	2		
Model4: C: That's great to hear. Well, I want you to know that we can work together and find the right solution for your needs.	Valid		4	4		
Model5: C: Please let me know until our next meeting how your situation at home will look like so I can prepare your abilities.	Valid		4	5		it's not our main task as psychologists to preper a person's mottor abilities. we could suggest them an occupational therapist in the hospital
P: Yes of course, thank you so much for considering that.						
						
C: Good afternoon. How are you doing today?						
P: I am very good. Thanks for asking. How are you?						
Model1: C: I'm doing well, thank you. I wanted to ask you a bit more about your daily activities. Can you tell me if there are any specific situations or times of day when moving around feels particularly challenging for you?						better to dont mention a subject or a problem, before the client mention it themshelves
Model2: C: I’m doing well, thank you. Let’s talk about your mobility today. Can you tell me a bit about how you move around at home?						it's better to ask the clients if they agree to talk about this topic
Model3: C: I'm doing well, thank you. To start off, could you tell me a bit about your main reason for coming in today? What's been on your mind lately?						
Model4: C: I’m doing well, thanks to my family and friends who keep me busy with their company.

Model3: C: It's understandable. Do you have any plans or ideas to spend more time with your grandchildren?	Valid		2	5

Model5: C: I understand. But now you can play with your grandkids and not miss out on any activity.	Invalid		5	5		it's better not to say what a client can do now and what they could not do before.

Model5: C: The feeling of being weak and unstable going on the bus is not there anymore?	Valid		5	3		
P: I mean I am still a bit more worried of falling than I was before, but it is no comparison to the last weeks. I felt wuite strong and comfortable on the bus, the train I felt even better, because it does not have so many turns as the bus does.	Valid					
Model1: C: It sounds like you're gaining confidence with each trip. Have you noticed any specific situations or environments where you still feel more cautious or uncertain?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: That’s really encouraging to hear. So, the train felt more stable for you because of fewer turns—did that help you feel more confident in your balance?	Valid		1	2		
Model3: C: That makes sense. And how did you feel when getting on and off the train? Did it take longer for you to get up from your seat or was there anything else that made you worry a bit more?	Valid		2	1		
Model4: C: That’s great to hear! So, the feeling of being weak is more manageable now. How did you feel about getting on and off the bus? Were there any particular challenges?	Valid		1	1		
Model5: C: I get what you mean. How did you deal with your luggage?	Valid		4	3

Model4: C: What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you when returning to work?	Valid		1	4		
Model5: C: Are you worried about something?	Valid		2	4		
P: The only thing is that I am afraid to go to quick into my old habits and my body is not ready for that yet.	Valid					
Model1: C: That makes sense. It’s important to take things at your own pace. Would you feel more comfortable if we set some small goals for the next few weeks to ease back into your routine?	Valid		1	2		
Model2: C: That’s a thoughtful concern. How do you plan to ease back into your old routines?	Valid		1	2		
Model3: C: That makes sense. We will take it slow, okay?	Valid		4	5		
Model4: C: That makes sense. Let’s talk more about your plans for the future and how we can support you in achieving them.	Valid		2	3

Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed any limitations in your ability to walk or move around at home, even with the taxi?	Invalid				even with the taxi is not a valid extension

Model4: C: That’s very uncomfortable. Have you noticed any changes in your pain level or intensity recently?	Valid		2	4		
Model5: C: What would you rate that pain on a scale from 0-10, 10 being the worst pain imaginable.	Valid		2	4		
P: It’s around an 8.	Valid					
Model1: C: That’s quite painful. Have you noticed any specific activities or times of day when the pain seems to get worse?	Valid		1	2

Model3: C: Have you had any recent changes in your living situation or activities that might be contributing to this pain?	Valid		2	3		
Model4: C: That’s quite severe. Have you been experiencing this pain for a while now, or has it recently started to become more frequent and intense?	Valid		2	4		
Model5: C: I can imagine you’re feeling quite frustrated by this pain and the inability to travel independently.	Valid		3	2

C: Good afternoon Mrs. Adams, my name is Greg.						
P: Oh please, call me Marguerite.						
Model1: C: Of course, Marguerite. I'm glad you could meet with me today. I understand you're concerned about your ability to move around safely at home. Could you tell me more about how you typically get from one place to another in your home?

Model4: C: Of course! How are you today, Marguerite?						
Model5: C: Marguerite, got it. Before we get started, I notice that your GP isn’t registered in our , do you happen to know his name?						
P: Yes of course, its Dr. Jacobs						
Model1: C: Thank you, Dr. Jacobs. I’ll make sure to note that down. Now, Marguerite, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your mobility and daily activities. Could you tell me if you’ve had any difficulty transferring yourself from a seated position to standing, such as when getting up from a chair or bed?						
Model2: C: Thank you, Dr. Jacobs is a pleasure to work with. Now, I understand you’ve been experiencing some difficulty with mobility lately—can you tell me more about what’s been happening?

P: Unfortunately, ever since October, I haven’t been able to travel to the city like I used to.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. Can you tell me more about what makes traveling to the city difficult for you? Are there specific steps or parts of the journey that feel challenging?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I see. Can you tell me more about what makes traveling to the city difficult for you?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That must be really frustrating for you. Can you tell me more about what’s been making it difficult to get around?	Valid		2	1		
Model4: C: I see. Is it a specific issue you're having with traveling, or more general mobility concerns?	Valid		1	2		
Model5: C: Before October, how did you travel into the city?	Valid		4	3		
P: I would take the tram close to my house.	Valid					
Model1: C: And once you got to the tram stop, how did you manage getting onto the tram? Did you need any assistance or have any difficulty with that part of the journey?	Valid		2	2		
Model2: C: And then how did you get from the tram to your destination? Did you walk, or use a mobility aid?	Valid		2	2		
Model3: C: And then you'd walk the rest of the way, right?	Invalid					
Model4: C: And once you were off the tram, how would you get to your destination?	Valid		2	3		
Model5: C: What makes it that you can no longer do that?	Valid		1	3		
P: I can, but no longer alone. I am dependent on my partner. He has to help me board and find a seat.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to move around or use your hands since October?	Valid		3	3		
Model2: C: I see. So you’re still able to take the tram, but you need assistance with boarding and finding a seat? Have you noticed any changes in your ability to move around independently, like walking or standing for longer periods?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That must be really frustrating for you. Have you tried using a mobility aid like a cane or walker to make it easier?	Valid		3	3		
Model4: C: That’s a big change. Do you feel like it affects your independence or freedom to go out and do things on your own?	Valid		3	4		
Model5: C: I see, what part of the journey do you struggle with most?	Valid		4	4		
P: Climbing the three steps onto the tram is painful, and I’m unsteady once I’m inside.	Valid					
Model1: C: How has this dependency on your partner affected your confidence or independence in other areas of daily life?	Valid		3	3		
Model2: C: How often do you need assistance with those steps—every time you take the tram, or just on certain days?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That sounds challenging. Are there any times of day or specific situations that make it easier for you?	Valid		1	1		
Model4: C: That makes sense. What about transferring to the train station—do you find that a challenge?	Valid		2	1		
Model5: C: That sounds frustrating. How does relying on someone else every day make you feel?	Valid		3	3		
P: It makes me feel a bit guilty but at the same time a little embarrassed.	Valid					
Model1: C: I appreciate you sharing that. Do you feel comfortable asking for help when you need it, or does the embarrassment make it harder for you to go out?	Valid		1	2		
Model2: C: That must be really difficult. Have you thought about any ways to make the trip easier or more independent, even if it’s just a small step?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about how that guilt and embarrassment affect your daily life?	Valid		3	3		
Model4: C: Do you find that it affects your mood or daily activities in other ways?	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: I can understand that but do note that it is nothing to be embarrassed about. Tell me, are you at all afraid you are going to fall?	Valid		3	3		
P: Very. A friend of mine recently fell and broke her hip. At the moment she can’t do anything at all anymore. God forbid that happens to me.	Valid					
Model1: C: That’s a valid concern, and it’s understandable given what you’ve heard about your friend. Have you talked to your partner about how you both feel about this situation?	Valid		1	2		
Model2: C: That’s a valid concern, and it’s completely natural to feel that way. Have you thought about any ways to make the tram journey safer or more manageable for you?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: That must be really worrying for you. Do you have anyone to help with groceries or other errands?	Valid		5	5		
Model4: C: That’s understandable, but we can work on solutions for your safety. Before we get to that though, do you have any other concerns about traveling?	Valid		1	2

P: I’ve been having trouble catching the city bus to work.	Valid					
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you face when trying to catch the bus?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s difficult when you try to catch the bus?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? What specifically is challenging for you?	Valid		1	2		
Model4: C: That sounds challenging. Can you tell me more about what’s happening with the bus?	Valid		3	3		
Model5: C: Why is that?	Valid		3	3		
P: The route the bus takes is extremely bumpy and every bump, or even a sudden stop, sends a jolting pain through my lower back.	Valid					
Model1: C: Have you noticed if this pain is related to any specific movements or positions when you're on the bus?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you tried using a different route or time of day to catch the bus?	Valid		3	2		
Model3: C: That sounds uncomfortable. Have you tried to adjust your position on the bus or use any support?	Valid		1	2		
Model4: C: That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you tried using a different route or time of day to avoid the worst parts?	Valid		3	2		
Model5: C: Is it focal or does the pain also radiate to any other locations in the body?	Valid		1	3		
P: Its purely in the lower back	Valid					
Model1: C: Have you noticed if the pain is worse at certain times of day or after specific activities?	Valid		1	2		
Model2: C: How long have you been experiencing this pain when riding the bus?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: How long have you been experiencing this pain and discomfort?	Valid		1	3		
Model4: C: How long have you been experiencing this?	Valid		1	3		
Model5: C: Could you rate this pain from 0, no pain at all, to 10, the worst pain ever?	Valid		1	3		
P: I would give it a 4 or a 5. The pain is manageable with pain killers, and albeit its annoying, halfway I have to transfer buses, which gives my back a break.	Valid					
Model1: C: I see. So you’re able to manage the pain with medication, and transferring buses helps give your back a break. Do you feel safe getting on and off the bus, or do you ever worry about losing balance or falling?	Valid		3	1		
Model2: C: That makes sense. So, when you’re on the bus, the bumps and sudden stops are what trigger the pain? Have you noticed if certain types of buses or routes are worse than others?	Valid		2	1		
Model3: C: Thank you for sharing that with me, Alex. Can I ask how this has been affecting your daily life and overall mood?	Valid		3	4		
Model4: C: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to transfer—like getting on and off the bus, or navigating stairs?	Valid		3	1		
Model5: C: What kind of painkillers do you take and do you take them every morning in anticipation of the bumpy bus ride?	Valid		2	2		
P: I take 2 paracetamols every morning before I go to work.	Valid					
Model1: C: Have you noticed if the pain changes in intensity or feels different at any point during your bus ride?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: Have you noticed any specific times of day when the pain is more or less bothersome?	Valid		2	2		
Model3: C: Do you find that helps with the pain at all when on public transport?	Valid		2	1		
Model4: C: That’s helpful to know. Have you tried using a mobility aid, like a cane or walker on the bus?	Valid		3	2		
Model5: C: Do you ever feel frustrated or discouraged traveling to work.	Valid		3	2		
P: Honestly yes but I need the money so I never take any days off.	Valid					
Model1: C: It sounds like you’re managing your pain effectively, but the frustration of daily travel must be challenging. Have you considered any alternative transportation options that might be smoother or more comfortable for your back?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: That’s really understandable, and I appreciate your dedication to work. Have you considered any alternative transportation options that might be easier on your back?	Valid		2	1		
Model3: C: That makes sense, but have you considered any other transportation options like a taxi or rideshare services?	Valid		3	2		
Model4: C: What are your plans for the future? Do you think this situation will change, or is it something that will be a long-term challenge?	Valid		5	3		
Model5: C: Has your back pain affected your confidence in getting around independently?	Valid		1	3		
P: No, I wouldn’t say so. I get to where I need to be but and I’m confident in my ability to do so. The journey is simply a nuisance and frustrating.	Valid					
Model1: C: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It sounds like your main concern is the discomfort and frustration during the bus ride rather than a loss of independence. Have you considered alternative transportation options, such as a smoother route or using a different mode of transport, like a taxi or rideshare, to reduce the impact on your back?	Valid		1	1		
Model2: C: That’s good to hear you feel confident in your ability to get around. Have you considered alternative transportation options that might be smoother or less jarring for your back?	Valid		1	1		
Model3: C: What do you think would make it easier for you to travel?	Valid		1	1		
Model4: C: Do you have any support system for dealing with the stress of these daily challenges?	Valid		1	1		
Model5: C: I know what you mean. I’ll take a look at your back and afterwards we’ll come up with a treatment plan to solve this issue.	Invalid		3	3	invalid because of 'solve'	
P: Alright.						
						
C: Hello Jane, it’s good to see you again, how are you today?

Model1: C: That’s great to hear. I noticed you mentioned some difficulty moving around recently—could you tell me more about when and where this happens?	Valid		1	2
