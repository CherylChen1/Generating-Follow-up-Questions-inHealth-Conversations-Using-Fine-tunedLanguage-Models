C: Good morning Carla, how are you?					
P: Best day ever. I am so good. How are you?					
Model1: C: Thank you, Carla! I’m doing well too. I wanted to ask you a bit more about your mobility today—have you had any difficulty transferring yourself from one place to another, like from the bed to the chair?	Valid		1	5	
Model2: C: I'm doing well, thank you. Let's talk about your mobility today—how have things been going with getting around?	Valid		1	3

Model5: C: I am also doing good. What is going on that you are so great?					
P: Yesterday I used the bus and then afterwards the train completely on my own and nothing bad happened.					
Model1: C: That’s wonderful to hear! Can you tell me more about how you managed getting on and off the bus and train — did you need any assistance or support from others?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: That’s fantastic to hear! How did it feel being on the bus and train—did you have any trouble with getting on or off, or navigating the space?	Valid		1	1

Model3: C: Did you have any challenges getting on or off the bus?	Valid		1	1	
Model4: C: Great! Did you have any trouble getting on or off the bus and train?	Valid		1	1	
Model5: C: The feeling of being weak and unstable going on the bus is not there anymore?	Valid		5	3	
P: I mean I am still a bit more worried of falling than I was before, but it is no comparison to the last weeks. I felt wuite strong and comfortable on the bus, the train I felt even better, because it does not have so many turns as the bus does.	Valid				
Model1: C: It sounds like you're gaining confidence with each trip. Have you noticed any specific situations or environments where you still feel more cautious or uncertain?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: That’s really encouraging to hear. So, the train felt more stable for you because of fewer turns—did that help you feel more confident in your balance?	Valid		1	2	
Model3: C: That makes sense. And how did you feel when getting on and off the train? Did it take longer for you to get up from your seat or was there anything else that made you worry a bit more?	Valid		2	1	
Model4: C: That’s great to hear! So, the feeling of being weak is more manageable now. How did you feel about getting on and off the bus? Were there any particular challenges?	Valid		1	1	
Model5: C: I get what you mean. How did you deal with your luggage?	Valid		4	3	
P: I had only a little bagpack with me and that was completly fine. Next time I will use a carry one just for practice. Then I know for sure if I am caoable of dealing with it on my own.	Valid				
Model1: C: That sounds like a great plan for practice. Have you considered how you might feel when carrying the bagpack, and if there are any specific steps or strategies that make you feel more confident?	Valid		2	1	
Model2: C: That’s a great plan—practicing with a carry-on will help build confidence. Have you noticed any specific moments during the trip where you felt unsure or had to adjust your movement?	Valid		2	1	
Model3: C: That is a good plan. It sounds like you are becoming more confident with your mobility.	Valid		3	3	
Model4: C: That’s a great plan. What about the steps from the train platform to your apartment?	Valid		2	1

Model3: C: Well, we can always use your help for some other tasks. How are you feeling about getting back to work?	Valid		3	3	
Model4: C: Oh, we are going to miss you.	Valid		5	5	
Model5: C: Which is sad for me, but great for you.	Valid		5	5	
P: Exactly.	Valid				
Model1: C: I’m really glad to hear that you’re feeling more confident and independent. Is there anything else you’d like to work on before you finish your sessions?	Valid		1	2

Model5: C: How did your family react to your news?	Valid		3	5	
P: They love it. As long as I am happy, they are also happy.	Valid

Model4: C: That is wonderful. What about your future plans?	Valid		3	4	
Model5: C: Are you excited to go back to work?	Valid		5	4

Model1: C: That’s wonderful to hear. Do you feel confident about returning to work, or would you like to prepare in any specific way?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: That’s wonderful to hear. I’m so glad you’re feeling more confident and excited about your return to work. Do you feel like you have the support you need to manage your commute and tasks at work?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: Sounds wonderful. What do you think is the most important thing that has changed for you since your accident?	Valid		2	4	
Model4: C: What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you when returning to work?	Valid		1	4	
Model5: C: Are you worried about something?	Valid		2	4	
P: The only thing is that I am afraid to go to quick into my old habits and my body is not ready for that yet.	Valid				
Model1: C: That makes sense. It’s important to take things at your own pace. Would you feel more comfortable if we set some small goals for the next few weeks to ease back into your routine?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: That’s a thoughtful concern. How do you plan to ease back into your old routines?	Valid		1	2	
Model3: C: That makes sense. We will take it slow, okay?	Valid		4	5	
Model4: C: That makes sense. Let’s talk more about your plans for the future and how we can support you in achieving them.	Valid		2	3	
Model5: C: Just listen to your body and it will be fine.	Invalid		5	5

P: I have trouble using transportation.	Valid				
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you face when using transportation? Do you find it difficult to get on or off the vehicle, or is it more about navigating around the bus stop or street?	Valid		3	1	
Model2: C: Can you tell me more about what’s difficult when you use transportation? Is it getting in or out of the vehicle, driving, or something else?	Valid		3	1	
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? What kind of transportation do you usually use?	Valid		1	2	
Model4: C: Can you tell me more about that? What kind of transportation do you use, and what makes it challenging for you?	Valid		1	2

Model2: C: I see. How long have you been experiencing this knee pain?	Valid		2	3	
Model3: C: That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me more about your experiences with taxis? For instance, have there been any particular challenges or situations that make it difficult for you?	Invalid		5	5

Model5: C: That sounds worrisome. Could you tell me a bit more about your pain? Where is it and what exacerbates it.	Valid		2	4	
P: So, it’s my left knee, and every time I put weight on it, there is a severe stabbing pain. It feels as if its deep inside the knee.	Valid				
Model1: C: I see. That must be very challenging for you. Have you noticed any specific situations or times of day when the pain seems to get worse?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: I see. Have you noticed any limitations in your ability to walk or move around at home, even with the taxi?	Invalid				even with the taxi is not a valid extension
Model3: C: That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you tried any treatments for this pain yet?	Valid		3	4	
Model4: C: That’s very uncomfortable. Have you noticed any changes in your pain level or intensity recently?	Valid		2	4	
Model5: C: What would you rate that pain on a scale from 0-10, 10 being the worst pain imaginable.	Valid		2	4	
P: It’s around an 8.	Valid				
Model1: C: That’s quite painful. Have you noticed any specific activities or times of day when the pain seems to get worse?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: That’s quite intense. Have you noticed any specific activities or times of day when the pain is worse?	Valid		1	2	
Model3: C: Have you had any recent changes in your living situation or activities that might be contributing to this pain?	Valid		2	3	
Model4: C: That’s quite severe. Have you been experiencing this pain for a while now, or has it recently started to become more frequent and intense?	Valid		2	4	
Model5: C: I can imagine you’re feeling quite frustrated by this pain and the inability to travel independently.	Valid		3	2	
P: Yeah it really is, I just want to know what’s wrong with my leg and how I can fix it. I would do anything for that to happen.	Valid				
Model1: C: I appreciate your determination, Liam. Let’s start by understanding more about how this pain affects your daily life — for example, are there specific times of day when the pain is worse, or does it interfere with any activities beyond just using transportation?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: That’s understandable, Liam. It sounds like you’re really hoping for clarity and a way forward. Have you noticed any specific activities or times of day when the pain seems to get worse?	Valid		1	2	
Model3: C: That’s understandable. Can you tell me a bit more about your daily life and activities? What do you enjoy doing when you’re not feeling too bad?	Valid		3	3	
Model4: C: That makes sense. Have you noticed any changes in your daily activities or routines because of this pain?	Valid		2	3	
Model5: C: I completely understand. We’ll get to the bottom of your knee pain.	Valid		3	5	
P: You’re a life saver					
					
C: Good afternoon Mrs. Adams, my name is Greg.					
P: Oh please, call me Marguerite.					
Model1: C: Of course, Marguerite. I'm glad you could meet with me today. I understand you're concerned about your ability to move around safely at home. Could you tell me more about how you typically get from one place to another in your home?					
Model2: C: Of course, Marguerite. How are you today?					
Model3: C: Of course, Marguerite. How are you feeling today?					
Model4: C: Of course! How are you today, Marguerite?					
Model5: C: Marguerite, got it. Before we get started, I notice that your GP isn’t registered in our , do you happen to know his name?					
P: Yes of course, its Dr. Jacobs					
Model1: C: Thank you, Dr. Jacobs. I’ll make sure to note that down. Now, Marguerite, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your mobility and daily activities. Could you tell me if you’ve had any difficulty transferring yourself from a seated position to standing, such as when getting up from a chair or bed?					
Model2: C: Thank you, Dr. Jacobs is a pleasure to work with. Now, I understand you’ve been experiencing some difficulty with mobility lately—can you tell me more about what’s been happening?					
Model3: C: And how did you find out about us? Was it through a referral or just online?					
Model4: C: Dr. Jacobs, thank you for referring us.					
Model5: C: Alright, perfect, I added it to your file. What brings you in today?					
P: Unfortunately, ever since October, I haven’t been able to travel to the city like I used to.	Valid				
Model1: C: I see. Can you tell me more about what makes traveling to the city difficult for you? Are there specific steps or parts of the journey that feel challenging?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: I see. Can you tell me more about what makes traveling to the city difficult for you?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: That must be really frustrating for you. Can you tell me more about what’s been making it difficult to get around?	Valid		2	1	
Model4: C: I see. Is it a specific issue you're having with traveling, or more general mobility concerns?	Valid		1	2	
Model5: C: Before October, how did you travel into the city?	Valid		4	3	
P: I would take the tram close to my house.	Valid				
Model1: C: And once you got to the tram stop, how did you manage getting onto the tram? Did you need any assistance or have any difficulty with that part of the journey?	Valid		2	2	
Model2: C: And then how did you get from the tram to your destination? Did you walk, or use a mobility aid?	Valid		2	2	
Model3: C: And then you'd walk the rest of the way, right?	Invalid				
Model4: C: And once you were off the tram, how would you get to your destination?	Valid		2	3	
Model5: C: What makes it that you can no longer do that?	Valid		1	3	
P: I can, but no longer alone. I am dependent on my partner. He has to help me board and find a seat.	Valid				
Model1: C: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to move around or use your hands since October?	Valid		3	3	
Model2: C: I see. So you’re still able to take the tram, but you need assistance with boarding and finding a seat? Have you noticed any changes in your ability to move around independently, like walking or standing for longer periods?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: That must be really frustrating for you. Have you tried using a mobility aid like a cane or walker to make it easier?	Valid		3	3	
Model4: C: That’s a big change. Do you feel like it affects your independence or freedom to go out and do things on your own?	Valid		3	4	
Model5: C: I see, what part of the journey do you struggle with most?	Valid		4	4	
P: Climbing the three steps onto the tram is painful, and I’m unsteady once I’m inside.	Valid				
Model1: C: How has this dependency on your partner affected your confidence or independence in other areas of daily life?	Valid		3	3	
Model2: C: How often do you need assistance with those steps—every time you take the tram, or just on certain days?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: That sounds challenging. Are there any times of day or specific situations that make it easier for you?	Valid		1	1	
Model4: C: That makes sense. What about transferring to the train station—do you find that a challenge?	Valid		2	1	
Model5: C: That sounds frustrating. How does relying on someone else every day make you feel?	Valid		3	3	
P: It makes me feel a bit guilty but at the same time a little embarrassed.	Valid				
Model1: C: I appreciate you sharing that. Do you feel comfortable asking for help when you need it, or does the embarrassment make it harder for you to go out?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: That must be really difficult. Have you thought about any ways to make the trip easier or more independent, even if it’s just a small step?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about how that guilt and embarrassment affect your daily life?	Valid		3	3	
Model4: C: Do you find that it affects your mood or daily activities in other ways?	Valid		3	3	
Model5: C: I can understand that but do note that it is nothing to be embarrassed about. Tell me, are you at all afraid you are going to fall?	Valid		3	3	
P: Very. A friend of mine recently fell and broke her hip. At the moment she can’t do anything at all anymore. God forbid that happens to me.	Valid				
Model1: C: That’s a valid concern, and it’s understandable given what you’ve heard about your friend. Have you talked to your partner about how you both feel about this situation?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: That’s a valid concern, and it’s completely natural to feel that way. Have you thought about any ways to make the tram journey safer or more manageable for you?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: That must be really worrying for you. Do you have anyone to help with groceries or other errands?	Valid		5	5	
Model4: C: That’s understandable, but we can work on solutions for your safety. Before we get to that though, do you have any other concerns about traveling?	Valid		1	2	
Model5: C: Thank you for sharing	Valid		5	5	
					
C: Hi, I’m Jenna, your physiotherapist, what’s your name?

Model2: C: Nice to meet you, Alex. How are you feeling today?					
Model3: C: Nice to meet you, Alex. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?					
Model4: C: Nice to meet you, Alex. How old are you?					
Model5: C: Nice to meet you, Alex. How has your day been so far?					
P: It’s been alright.					
Model1: C: I'm glad to hear that. Can you tell me a bit about how you usually get around during the day?					
Model2: C: Thank you for coming in today, Alex. Can you tell me a bit about why you’re here?					
Model3: C: That’s great to hear. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here today?					
Model4: C: Anything exciting happening today?					
Model5: C: What brings you in today?					
P: I’ve been having trouble catching the city bus to work.	Valid				
Model1: C: Can you tell me more about the specific challenges you face when trying to catch the bus?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s difficult when you try to catch the bus?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: Can you tell me more about that? What specifically is challenging for you?	Valid		1	2	
Model4: C: That sounds challenging. Can you tell me more about what’s happening with the bus?	Valid		3	3	
Model5: C: Why is that?	Valid		3	3	
P: The route the bus takes is extremely bumpy and every bump, or even a sudden stop, sends a jolting pain through my lower back.	Valid				
Model1: C: Have you noticed if this pain is related to any specific movements or positions when you're on the bus?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you tried using a different route or time of day to catch the bus?	Valid		3	2	
Model3: C: That sounds uncomfortable. Have you tried to adjust your position on the bus or use any support?	Valid		1	2	
Model4: C: That sounds really uncomfortable. Have you tried using a different route or time of day to avoid the worst parts?	Valid		3	2	
Model5: C: Is it focal or does the pain also radiate to any other locations in the body?	Valid		1	3	
P: Its purely in the lower back	Valid				
Model1: C: Have you noticed if the pain is worse at certain times of day or after specific activities?	Valid		1	2	
Model2: C: How long have you been experiencing this pain when riding the bus?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: How long have you been experiencing this pain and discomfort?	Valid		1	3	
Model4: C: How long have you been experiencing this?	Valid		1	3	
Model5: C: Could you rate this pain from 0, no pain at all, to 10, the worst pain ever?	Valid		1	3	
P: I would give it a 4 or a 5. The pain is manageable with pain killers, and albeit its annoying, halfway I have to transfer buses, which gives my back a break.	Valid				
Model1: C: I see. So you’re able to manage the pain with medication, and transferring buses helps give your back a break. Do you feel safe getting on and off the bus, or do you ever worry about losing balance or falling?	Valid		3	1	
Model2: C: That makes sense. So, when you’re on the bus, the bumps and sudden stops are what trigger the pain? Have you noticed if certain types of buses or routes are worse than others?	Valid		2	1	
Model3: C: Thank you for sharing that with me, Alex. Can I ask how this has been affecting your daily life and overall mood?	Valid		3	4	
Model4: C: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to transfer—like getting on and off the bus, or navigating stairs?	Valid		3	1	
Model5: C: What kind of painkillers do you take and do you take them every morning in anticipation of the bumpy bus ride?	Valid		2	2	
P: I take 2 paracetamols every morning before I go to work.	Valid				
Model1: C: Have you noticed if the pain changes in intensity or feels different at any point during your bus ride?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: Have you noticed any specific times of day when the pain is more or less bothersome?	Valid		2	2	
Model3: C: Do you find that helps with the pain at all when on public transport?	Valid		2	1	
Model4: C: That’s helpful to know. Have you tried using a mobility aid, like a cane or walker on the bus?	Valid		3	2	
Model5: C: Do you ever feel frustrated or discouraged traveling to work.	Valid		3	2	
P: Honestly yes but I need the money so I never take any days off.	Valid				
Model1: C: It sounds like you’re managing your pain effectively, but the frustration of daily travel must be challenging. Have you considered any alternative transportation options that might be smoother or more comfortable for your back?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: That’s really understandable, and I appreciate your dedication to work. Have you considered any alternative transportation options that might be easier on your back?	Valid		2	1	
Model3: C: That makes sense, but have you considered any other transportation options like a taxi or rideshare services?	Valid		3	2	
Model4: C: What are your plans for the future? Do you think this situation will change, or is it something that will be a long-term challenge?	Valid		5	3	
Model5: C: Has your back pain affected your confidence in getting around independently?	Valid		1	3	
P: No, I wouldn’t say so. I get to where I need to be but and I’m confident in my ability to do so. The journey is simply a nuisance and frustrating.	Valid				
Model1: C: Thank you for sharing that, Alex. It sounds like your main concern is the discomfort and frustration during the bus ride rather than a loss of independence. Have you considered alternative transportation options, such as a smoother route or using a different mode of transport, like a taxi or rideshare, to reduce the impact on your back?	Valid		1	1	
Model2: C: That’s good to hear you feel confident in your ability to get around. Have you considered alternative transportation options that might be smoother or less jarring for your back?	Valid		1	1	
Model3: C: What do you think would make it easier for you to travel?	Valid		1	1	
Model4: C: Do you have any support system for dealing with the stress of these daily challenges?	Valid		1	1	
Model5: C: I know what you mean. I’ll take a look at your back and afterwards we’ll come up with a treatment plan to solve this issue.	Invalid		3	3	invalid because of 'solve'
P: Alright.

Model5: C: Have you been facing any troubles taking the bus to work?	Valid		4	3	
P: A bit, but I can tell that things are going in the positive direction.	Valid
