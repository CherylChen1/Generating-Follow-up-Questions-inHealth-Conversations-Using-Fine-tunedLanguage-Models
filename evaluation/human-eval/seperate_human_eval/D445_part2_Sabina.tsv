Model5: C: OK in which range you start to feel pain.	Valid		1	5			
P: it's like not much for instant, for example when I am trying to use key and open my door when I am twisting my wrist with a little bit of resistant and pressure then I start to feel a little bit.							
Model1: C: I see. So the pain is more noticeable when you're applying resistance or pressure during twisting movements, like turning a key. Does this affect your ability to perform daily tasks or does it cause concern about further injury?	Valid		1	2			
Model2: C: Got it. So the pain comes when you’re applying some resistance or pressure while twisting your wrist, like turning a key? Does it feel more like a sharp pain or a dull ache?	Valid		1	2			
Model3: C: got it thank you for explaining. Is there anything else that might be helpful in terms of managing this pain or any specific situations where the discomfort is more pronounced?	Valid		1	5
